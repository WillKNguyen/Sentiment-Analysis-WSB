3537,Buy,TSLA,,BonerballsDickfart,hlyyut,266,283,"I bought my first TSLA shares on IPO day amid everyone from Jim Cramer to auto industry friends making compelling counterarguments:

* ƒ??They canƒ??t make a profit/Theyƒ??re hemorrhaging money.ƒ?
* ƒ??Other car companies are going to make electric cars and eat their lunch.ƒ?
* ƒ??What are you, fucking stupid?ƒ?

I still have those shares, and many more I bought along the way. I think it is more than a $1200/share company, and this is my optimistic justification.

1. Tesla has more or less consistently maintained a decent gross margin, usually higher than most other automotive companies. Theyƒ??ve mostly been in the position where they could be consistently profitable if they only focused on existing products. Theyƒ??ve seen a huge expansion in the last few years, outfitting and growing the Fremont factory, Nevadaƒ??s factory, Buffalo, and Shanghai, as well as dozens of other small operations around those areas. Germany is coming up, Austin soon, ramping up design, manufacturing, and business employees for new products in automotive, solar, stationary storageƒ?? all that and a consistently increasing revenue, and still people say ƒ??ThEy LoSt $0.20 PeR ShArE ThEyƒ??Re HeMoRrHaGiNg MoNeYƒ?
2. Electric cars are better. More power, way fewer moving parts, lower total cost of ownership, and there are also mandates by many countries to go all EV. You say that GM and Toyota will start making electric cars and take their share? Car companies are bureaucratic design-by-committee dinosaurs afraid of anything but incremental change. They will forever be one step behind with a worse car that nobody is excited about. People who own Tesla cars love them, and people who donƒ??t own them want one. Ainƒ??t nobody excited about the next Corolla. Ainƒ??t nobody give a fuck what loaf Fiat is pinching off next year. Fifteen years from now Tesla will absolutely be worth what Toyota is worth, and probably also a couple other auto companies that wonƒ??t make it. $285B
3. Self driving is coming. Probably not tomorrow, but within the timeframe of investment consideration. Self driving is a data problem, and Tesla has fuckloads more data than anyone else. More than they know what to do with. If a car can safely drive itself, the car manufacturer isnƒ??t going to sell those cars to Uber. Theyƒ??re going to start their own app and slide the entire market cap of ride sharing companies into their own. $100B
4. In a few months, itƒ??s speculated that Tesla will announce its million-mile battery. This is important for a couple of reasons. It will help them take over the trucking industry with a far cheaper per-mile product ($40B). It also allows the cars to be used for stationary storage. You donƒ??t need a 400 mile range every day. You almost never need it. Plug in your car at night and charge it up with cheap electricity. Drive to work and plug it in and set your car to sell back some energy at peak hours. This is what some people are speculating battery day will be about. You need what, 15 miles of range to get home? Sell the rest, make some money. Tesla will take something like 30% just like Apple does when you sell an app. Their $40,000 car now has a total cost of ownership less than a $20,000 gas car. You gonna buy a Tesla or a Kia Forte? If this happens, Tesla sells fuckloads more cars, and makes fuckloads more money as an energy selling middle man. 100B
5. Short shorts. 0.005B
6. Stationary storage and solar. Nobody making batteries like Tesla making batteries, and their solar is getting cheaper and growing rapidly. Iƒ??m tired of typing, you're tired of reading. $75B

$600 Billion dollar market cap. $3250 share price.

But what about Ghislaine Maxwell? And what happens when NIO steals all their secrets? What about Elonƒ??s obviously deteriorating health and the fact that his brother is 2/3rds lizard person? If those things are worrying you, literally reevaluate your entire life.

ƒ??You make a compelling argument BonerballsDickfart, but they havenƒ??t actually done any of that yet.ƒ? Yeah, no fucking shit, investing isnƒ??t about whatƒ??s done, itƒ??s about whatƒ??s going to be done. For years, the question was whether or not Tesla could survive and deliver. They just made it through a global pandemic better than any other car company. Investors are realizing all this shit is coming, and thatƒ??s why the stock is shooting up. Am I wrong? Possibly. I did just write 800 words to a subreddit that canƒ??t be bothered to read the bottom of a Snapple bottle cap. I also probably overdid the addy this morning and I havenƒ??t taken a shit in two days. Itƒ??s also possible that Elon goes full Howard Hughes, starts pissing in milk jars, names his kid something nonsensical and endorses Kanye West for president.

But what are the odds of that?

TL;DR Eat several bags of dicks.

7256,Buy,GME,,gardeeon,kxzrp5,1086,3320,"Good morning, and good afternoon, fellow Retards. I haven't had the need to make a post, until now. What a fucking fantastic day we've had in the past couple of days. Now, you've probably caught the itch to make it big with all the talks of a short squeeze, seeing as the topic has ignited with a bunch of fresh blood recently with the extreme media coverage of WSJ, Cramer, and various other media outlets. I've been in GME for about 5 or 6 months, nowhere near as long u/UberKikz11, u/DeepFuckingValue, and u/CptHubbard of course, but for the past 5 months. All I have been doing is watching this stock, reading the news, visiting stores around the state to get updates from local employees, and so much more.   
What I want every single one of you to realize, is this one of the most artificially suppressed stocks on the market. Short sellers have more shares sold short than there are shares in existence for Gamestop. 71.2 MILLION sold short,^(\[1\]) versus an entire outstanding (heh nice) 69.75 Million shares outstanding. Now, let's do some number crunching. 19.25%, or \~13.4m of those shares^(\[2\]), are held by insiders. Our faithful Board of directors, including big dog Ryan Cohen with OVER 9000!!!(9,001,000) shares. leaving us with \~56.35m to play around with. Next stop, Institutional ownership, The big holders. So, of that 56.35m, the top 10 institutional holders hold 43,429,550 ^(\[3\]) and the top 10 mutual funds hold 18,746,499 ^(\[3\])  Totalling 62,176,049. So now just between the previously listed holders we have. \*drum rolls\* 75 Million shares owned by insiders and institutions. WAIT WAIT WAIT HOLD THE PHONE... How is that possible? 75 million shares solely owned by institutions, when there are only 69.75 in existence.  Short sellers. This is where the magnitude of the situation begins. All the shares you are trading right now, all of them that you own, are more than likely a share sold short. So, when the shorts cover their position... well, there just won't fucking be any without you selling their share sold short back to them, because institutions don't like to sell until they see BIG returns. Every single shareholder, whether it is your 1, 100, or 10,000 shares that you own right now, is the key.  YOU HOLD THE POWER! I need every single one of you to have faith through the dips and buy more, you are doing your part just by buying one more share on the dip, even more, when you buy 2 or 3 or 100. The key here is to HOLD YOUR FUCKING SHARES UNTIL SHORTS BLEED THEIR LAST DROP, AND ONLY THEN WILL WE SAY, ""Wait, you can sell these things?"" We are up against some big money here. Big money means they can bleed before covering their positions, but they are a business, they don't want to have big losses, so the covering WILL happen, and that is when we will see our squeeze. We haven't even started retards. Keep up the buying pressure with shares.  Your efforts, and patience, will GREATLY be rewarded.

TL,DR: Shorts fukt, bulls win. Buy SHARES, not calls, and HOLD THE LINE until 420.69 (I have full faith in that sell target) GME TO THE MOON ????????????????????????????????????

That's why it's important to buy shares and to hold. And if you want to buy options buy ITM so it's harder for hedgies to manipulate the stock.

So the CTB has been dropping slightly but remains elevated. Not to worry. Why you say? Because the exact same thing happened to AMC back in May when the CTB jumped to 82% and tapered back down to 6%. And do you chimps remember what happened? $AMC skyrocketed 500% within a couple of weeks. And the short interest then was only 21% of the float.

Let me share some charts so you can see the striking similarities:

You see the striking similarity between the W formation and how it's starting to consolidate now around $7?

Friday is when the new shorts where supposed to report closing 9/30/21 which I suspect will put SI of float even higher than 35%. If you look at how much shorting activity took place on 9/20/21 after we tested $7 compared to previous days, it's substantially more.

Ryan Cohen posted a series of tweets back in Jan or February with the images of shorts and a black flag then a purple heart later on

What if the short squeeze didnt have anything to do with what people thought it was then due to a merger or acquisition of bbby was actually finalizing in agreement

What if it was just him saying hey guys look things are about to happen and one fateful day there was a post about his actual involvement..

I am just saying that the media wouldnt pump so hard if there wasn't enough stake to be lost... They tried killing it before it became a thing and then all of the bots came out to play.

Crazy enough.. It actually could be a thing..

This separates any of the current gud thats coming around and directly relates to an option no one talked about.. What if the short squeeze was in fact due to a merger and not a spin off.

It makes sense with his background for rc to do this... He fought head on with Amazon building chewy.. What if his master plan actually is to build another Amazon.. Jeff Bezos is not the one all say all and Amazon is great but there's more that could be done.. Amazon is quite diversified and the segment that has been lacking has been the update for the selling and buying interface.


AMC could have been a key player if they took a look and actually was able to provide the web streaming of movies or other possible avenues give it like Amazon prime video

Game stop and BBBY are avenues for selling products.. 

Thinking outside of the box.. Ryan Cohen's master plan is to build a different type of Amazon using the failing brick and mortar companies that will be acquired to form a conglomerate to battle the likes of Amazon... Rd ventures would be smart to play the activist role to do this..

This isnt the first time it's happened and I think this is the game plan. 

Amazon has aws which is a bigger focus for bezos than the rest of the company..

No one at this time has thought about it this way or posted it at least.

How do you combat a billion dollar company fast? You dont start small and hope it grows to be it.. You take value and merge that value to be a contender.. As long as you have the capital to do it.. 

Rc is a billionaire running under the guise of activist because the best way to pick up these companies is to acquire on the cheap and bring the little man to rally with it building name recognition and loyalty

24496,Buy,NOK,,ChillerID,s2vhp7,1,175,"On Monday 10th of Jan 2022, Nokia gave a positive profit warning and price jumped in Europe to 5.769 EUR (6.604 USD). Then started a heavy and systematic battering by market makers and the stock price is now close to $6.00.

One might wonder why? Well, the max pain level for Friday is $6.00 (level where bankers make most of the money). However more importantly the level on 21st of Jan is $5.00 and there are over **$1 billion** worth of ape money to be burned as those calls were opened during the meme hype in Jan 2021. Every cent closer to $5.00 makes more money to banks.

Why was $NOK part of the four main meme stocks? (BANG = BB, AMC, Nokia and GME)  
The reason is that Keith Gill alias u/deepfuckingvalue saw it as a potentially undervalued stock ([pic of his notebook in WSJ article](https://ibb.co/j6FFqG6)). He truly is a value investor and the hype was a consequence of huge amount of degenerates following him. Many stocks made a short squeeze but for Nokia it was more like a gamma squeeze and actually returning to a reasonable valuation level. Price doubled in one day with massive 1.2 billion volume (share count high but market value low compared to peers in telecom sector).

So, the share price for $NOK was around $4.00 last year January and now it's over $6.00. It's fair to say that DFV was right. Nokia has been making a great turnaround and future looks bright.

More or less this post is just a heads up for all value investor as the stock is currently battered and sold in my opinion with discounted price (Naked shorts based shares dumped to the market?). Make your own DD and buy if you see the potential (I'm not financial advisor).

Meanwhile it seems clear that market makers will maximize their profit and make some of you poor (personally I don't have any of those options but I feel you). Long-term investors will most likely focus on 3rd of Feb when Nokia will announce their plan to revive dividends and give future outlook. Company has a huge net cash, strong cashflow, second to none products in the industry and it's main competitor Chinese Huawei is suffering from US ban so despite of the short term headwinds caused by market manipulation the future seems promising.",Nokia $NOK is staying undervalued and market makers are currently battering to kill 21st of Jan call options,44574.10198,t3_s2vhp7,"Nokia $NOK is staying undervalued and market makers are currently battering to kill 21st of Jan call options On Monday 10th of Jan 2022, Nokia gave a positive profit warning and price jumped in Europe to 5.769 EUR (6.604 USD). Then started a heavy and systematic battering by market makers and the stock price is now close to $6.00.

One might wonder why? Well, the max pain level for Friday is $6.00 (level where bankers make most of the money). However more importantly the level on 21st of Jan is $5.00 and there are over **$1 billion** worth of ape money to be burned as those calls were opened during the meme hype in Jan 2021. Every cent closer to $5.00 makes more money to banks.

Why was $NOK part of the four main meme stocks? (BANG = BB, AMC, Nokia and GME)  
The reason is that Keith Gill alias u/deepfuckingvalue saw it as a potentially undervalued stock ([pic of his notebook in WSJ article](https://ibb.co/j6FFqG6)). He truly is a value investor and the hype was a consequence of huge amount of degenerates following him. Many stocks made a short squeeze but for Nokia it was more like a gamma squeeze and actually returning to a reasonable valuation level. Price doubled in one day with massive 1.2 billion volume (share count high but market value low compared to peers in telecom sector).

1. Dividend issued in August
2. $AMC commons on the balance sheet still show 516 million shares authorized and 516 million shares issued and outstanding. But now, there are 50 million Preferred shares\*^(1) authorized and 5.16 million shares issued and outstanding also on the balance sheet.
3. $APE coin initially trades at an 40-45% value of whatever $AMC was trading at the day before the split.
   1. example: $AMC = $20, then $APE = $8.50
4. $AMC's price falls and $APE increases in price with respect to each other. So if $APE = $8.50 then $AMC = $11.50 (which totals back to the $20)
5. There are some initial troubles with all shareholders receiving the dividend, but eventually, everyone receives what they are owed and therefore the pseudo ""share count"" reveals there aren't 29 billion synthetic AMC shares as the mouth breathers believe.
6. A few weeks go by and $AMC and $APE are now arbitrage plays until the vote for the preferred share conversion takes place.
7. The share conversion vote passes because every $APE has the same voting rights as $AMC commons and $AMC mouth breathers don't understand the negative implication of actually voting yes. Now $AMC and $APE will trade almost 1:1 in price due to the ability of conversion, although a very small arbitrage will still be available to profit off of.
8. A few more weeks go by and Adam Aaron announces a dilution of $APE by the means of an at-the-market issuance of $APE of around 100,000,000 shares (which is 10,000,000 Preferred shares added to their issued and outstanding) and raises $1 billion dollars (assuming a price of $10 per share).
9. $AMC mouth breathers celebrate in the masses thinking fat cat Adam Aaron's pounce plan was a success and issuing $APE raised the company money out of thin air. 
10. A few weeks go by and some $AMC mouth breathers actually start understanding what just happened and how their stock was diluted through a backdoor $AMC opened in 2013 by voting yes on the authorization of Preferred shares. 
11. Adam Aaron tries to issue 100,000,000 $APE again and this time shareholders vote no because they realize their bags are so heavy they might start generating their own gravitational force.
12. A year or two later, $AMC runs out of means to raise capital as their attendance is still 50% of 2019 levels and their shareholder base has completely lost faith in management, so they restructure or go bankrupt. 

*\***^(1)**: they purposely made the conversion of $APE to $AMC a confusing 2-step process so they can avoid scrutiny from shareholders who don't look into it or would never understand it in the first place.*

*1 $APE does not = 1 $AMC. In reality, 1 $APE = 1/100 (one one-hundredth) of a Preferred share and 1 Preferred share = 100 $AMC. Therefore, 7 $Ape = 7/100 of a Preferred which = 7 $AMC (7/100\*100 = 7)*

*and $AMC currently has the ability to issue 5 billion $APE shares (50 million Preferred shares) because they've already authorized them.*

This is a really sneaky and honestly quite evil play by Adam Aaron. He is assuming his shareholder base is a collective of blind people hopped up on Memestock Dew who are holding his hand waiting to cross the street once the light turns green.

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 1. Meme Status**

I've stated [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oib6l8/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite/) the definition of 'Meme Stock' I use, but in short it is thus: 

Meme-DDs get made &amp; price goes up--&gt;Options Wizards buy options &amp; **Thing** happens--&gt;idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand--&gt;diamond hands result in higher-low--&gt;repeat for next leg up.

Basically, there are two kinds of plays around here: True Memes and P&amp;Ds. The True Memes have two distinguishing features: 1) the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the **Thing**, and 2) after the retracement, the price action stabilizes at a **higher-low**. 

Obviously, this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud. I'm naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat, so take what you will from my ramblings. However, when comparing the likes of GME, AMC, BB and BBBY with things like RKT, CRSR, WISH, WOOF, etc, it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I'm calling the True Memes. 

So, is CLOV a True Meme? Answer: **it's hanging on by a worn thread**. 

It remains my contention that a higher-low is a requirement for the 'follow through' on these plays. After all, if the ticker returns back to its pre-meme price (which for many of these is the all-time low), or worse, goes even lower, what then did the 'diamond handing' accomplish? Answer: jack shit. Think of it this way: if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float, supply and demand dictate that the price *should* stabilize at a higher-low. Yes, the stock market is full of fuckery and it's not as simple as all that, but if the price just slides back to the low, the simple conclusion is: there are not as many of you as you think there are. 

Also, going back down to the pre-meme low, or worse, is about as demoralizing as it can get. Many so-called 'apes' are going to say 'fuck it, I was had' and dump their shares for a loss. Further, it is going to severally damage the image of the play, making it look like 'nothing more than another P&amp;D.'

Of course, I could be proven wrong here. CLOV could fall down and put in a new all-time low before shooting the moon. Who cares if your wrong as long as you still make money

&amp;#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 2. Cum-tastic Charts**

First, the daily chart with Cbass's patented horizontal lines:

[Clov-tastic](https://preview.redd.it/2p48jy2j27d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6072e7598b01fd3df17d33b2a42a28dd6ea97f)

My theory regarding the True Memes was not merely a higher-low, but that the higher-low should ***specifically*** be around the breakout level of the previous move. We are way the fuck under that, so I'm just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret. So I've just applied Cbass's Second Law of TA: When you're wrong, just move the lines until you're right again.

Last week, the ticker found some support at $8. Which is technically a 'higher-low', with the all-time low being $6.31. That's $1.69 higher. ***Impressive***. It was actually an obvious place to stabilize (for a few days). I mean, everyone and their mother knows the 92.5% Fibonacci retracement level is like, *totally* the real level and super-duper important. 

Next up, I've prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.

[Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something](https://preview.redd.it/7l37izwj57d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073)

As you can see here, I found the **hidden** downward wedge that we've already broken out of, and therefore the next logical stop is $100/share. ***This is how TA is done***. I've seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I'm pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting 'tons of shitty TA.' Bruh, you wish you had these skills. Cbass don't need no fuckin' Bollinger bands, Keltner somethings, so-called 'moving averages' or any of that fancy bullshit. I *could* do it all with horizontal lines, but look here, I figured out how to draw *other kinds of lines*.

Here's another example of my superior line-skills:

Here you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we're now not in ***that*** downward channel. Which means we **can't possibly** go down anymore. Again: $100/share imminent. Furthermore, the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support. Bruh, it just do get more bullish than this. 

Except if I do this:

Here, I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case. In this world, when the price gets back up to the red dashed line, it will be promptly rejected to $0. But I own this stock and this outcome doesn't make me any money, so for ***reasons*** this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 3. Donkey Dicks**

Now, I've never done DD on anything until *after* I bought it. Thus, in keeping with tradition I've taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40%. In short, it's ***basically shit.*** 

Someone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen, like: **disruptor, innovator, AI, machine learning, tech, growth, next-gen**, etc. Dude, these guys sell insurance to old people. Worse, they only sell one kind of insurance: Medicare Advantage. Will they make money in the future? Yeah, sure. But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days. You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self-driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat. You're high, but it is *technically* possible. Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base. And the government has their hand in the mix. 

""But their saving the government money with their ***software platform***!"" 1) The government doesn't actually give a fuck about saving money. If the past two years taught you nothing else, I hope this at least got through. 2) Calling a computer program a 'software platform' doesn't make it anything more than a program where you input information. Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel? I doubt it, but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect. It just looks like advertising to me; kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with 'app' in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone. Whatever, before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage, I'm going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I'll never get the chance to click those buttons. 

CLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers, e.g., United Health Care (UNH). UNH has a market cap *literally* 100x CLOV, and yet people are like ""CLOV totally ***deserves*** to be valued like UNH."" UNH has an income of $14.5**B**. CLOV is at -$55**M**. Even sitting at a market cap of $395**B**, UNH is only running a p/e of 27.6, with a forward p/e 19.4. They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank, thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon. You can point at the 80/20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spirally cost of health care in America and I'll nod my head and agree, but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day. They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs, in my opinion--assuming they have any effect at all. 

""But Clover is growing at ***double digits***!"" It's easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers. After 2023, I believe the estimate is 5-7% per year. It's not terrible, but it's not going to take you to the moon. If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys, then okay, there's some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around. But I've as much chance of snorting lines off the titties a Victoria's Secret model while raw-dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht... anchored off the pristine white sand beaches of my new private island.

&amp;#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 4. The Short-Term Gamble**

So, given that the TA on CLOV is a crap shoot (as all TA is) and the underlying company is less than amazing, why the fuck would anyone in their right mind buy this ticker. Simple: **gambling**. That is what CLOV was, is, and all it ever will be: a gamble. And *you came here gamble,* because this is the fucking casino. That's why I bought it. I was wrong about an immediate turn around after the first launch and so now I'm stuck sucking pond scum. Such is life. 

Is the short-term gamble over? No, not yet. As the charts show, CLOV is bottoming out, which means the next direction ***should*** be up. Obviously, because it's gambling, down is possible, but nobody came here to hear that. Furthermore, CLOV remains one of the top tickers sentiment-wise. A lot of eyes balls has the potential to materialize that sudden move upward that everyone is pretending they're not here for. On top of that, the SI remains high. I think the importance of SI is way overblown, but most people think otherwise and that belief alone will drive retail toward the ticker. Finally, it looks like the Options Wizard took one shot at this thing (I don't know this for certain), and there is a chance they will come back around to it if things start moving up. Thus, there remains the potential for a second massive launch. 

So let's assume someone is looking at this and thinking, ""Okay, based on the charts I might take a stab at this."" The next question is: Get in now, or wait for $7? This is impossible to answer, of course, but if you are like me, then if you buy now, it will drop to $7 because the stock market exists to fuck with you, ***specifically***. By the same rule, if you wait, then it will take off without you and you'll FOMO in at $25. Pick your poison.

Of course, my theory of these plays states a breakdown back to lows ends the play. If it does happen, I will obviously just revise my theory so that I'm still not wrong--because I do TA how it's supposed to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 5. The Long-Term Gamble**

Long-term, CLOV is still just a gamble. The delusional idiots will tell you this is a 'can't fail' investment. All investments can fail, including this one. People like the 'fall-back' position: i.e., I gambled on the short-term jump and lost, but that's okay because long-term this is a 100% winner. This is how you get ~~delusional bagholders~~ *a cult*. 

At the current price level, is CLOV a good long-term gamble? It's the definition of mediocre. Will it be at $500 in ten years, 'because that's where UNH is now.' Not unless JPow initiates hyperinflation, in which case that new fleshlight you've got on your Amazon wishlist is going to be a $1000--so, you know, *bigger* problems. A more reasonable target is mid-20s (low $30s at best) within 2-5 years assuming there is no moon landing and the retail interest dies off and CLOV becomes just another ticker in the garden. The current 12-month average price target is $10.30.  Again: **This is gambling**.

There are a bunch of believers for this stock (like any ticker that gets its own sub reddit), and I think if we end up in the long-gamble, much like poor Lord Stannis, they will be in for some disappointment.

\------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 6. And now my Watch has begun**

I'm a bagholder. I'm not gonna lie about, bullshit you, tell you I'm happy about it, or claim I've discovered the secret to curing your financial woes. Much like Stannis, First of His Name, Rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, I thought I was to be the savoir of my own story and yet here I am, freezing my balls off at the Wall with a bunch flee-ridden dudes and an old lady in magic makeup, waiting to see if the cold or the ice zombies kill me first. 

As you can see from my positions below, I'm not in the worst spot--not in the best, either. My odds of break-even are pretty good. I might have to wait two years to get there, but I think I'll get there even if CLOV falls off the face of the internet. My odds of doubling my money are okay, if I'm patient enough. Which I won't be... obviously. Odds of 10x in 10 years *without* the Wizardry: 0.1%, ***exactly***. Like all my trades, my entry into this position is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda's. So it is will us all.

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 1. Meme Status**

I've stated [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oib6l8/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite/) the definition of 'Meme Stock' I use, but in short it is thus: 

Meme-DDs get made &amp; price goes up--&gt;Options Wizards buy options &amp; **Thing** happens--&gt;idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand--&gt;diamond hands result in higher-low--&gt;repeat for next leg up.

Basically, there are two kinds of plays around here: True Memes and P&amp;Ds. The True Memes have two distinguishing features: 1) the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the **Thing**, and 2) after the retracement, the price action stabilizes at a **higher-low**. 

Obviously, this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud. I'm naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat, so take what you will from my ramblings. However, when comparing the likes of GME, AMC, BB and BBBY with things like RKT, CRSR, WISH, WOOF, etc, it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I'm calling the True Memes. 

So, is CLOV a True Meme? Answer: **it's hanging on by a worn thread**. 

It remains my contention that a higher-low is a requirement for the 'follow through' on these plays. After all, if the ticker returns back to its pre-meme price (which for many of these is the all-time low), or worse, goes even lower, what then did the 'diamond handing' accomplish? Answer: jack shit. Think of it this way: if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float, supply and demand dictate that the price *should* stabilize at a higher-low. Yes, the stock market is full of fuckery and it's not as simple as all that, but if the price just slides back to the low, the simple conclusion is: there are not as many of you as you think there are. 

Also, going back down to the pre-meme low, or worse, is about as demoralizing as it can get. Many so-called 'apes' are going to say 'fuck it, I was had' and dump their shares for a loss. Further, it is going to severally damage the image of the play, making it look like 'nothing more than another P&amp;D.'

Of course, I could be proven wrong here. CLOV could fall down and put in a new all-time low before shooting the moon. Who cares if your wrong as long as you still make money

&amp;#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 2. Cum-tastic Charts**

First, the daily chart with Cbass's patented horizontal lines:

[Clov-tastic](https://preview.redd.it/2p48jy2j27d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6072e7598b01fd3df17d33b2a42a28dd6ea97f)

My theory regarding the True Memes was not merely a higher-low, but that the higher-low should ***specifically*** be around the breakout level of the previous move. We are way the fuck under that, so I'm just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret. So I've just applied Cbass's Second Law of TA: When you're wrong, just move the lines until you're right again.

Last week, the ticker found some support at $8. Which is technically a 'higher-low', with the all-time low being $6.31. That's $1.69 higher. ***Impressive***. It was actually an obvious place to stabilize (for a few days). I mean, everyone and their mother knows the 92.5% Fibonacci retracement level is like, *totally* the real level and super-duper important. 

Next up, I've prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart &amp; indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.

[Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something](https://preview.redd.it/7l37izwj57d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073)

As you can see here, I found the **hidden** downward wedge that we've already broken out of, and therefore the next logical stop is $100/share. ***This is how TA is done***. I've seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I'm pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting 'tons of shitty TA.' Bruh, you wish you had these skills. Cbass don't need no fuckin' Bollinger bands, Keltner somethings, so-called 'moving averages' or any of that fancy bullshit. I *could* do it all with horizontal lines, but look here, I figured out how to draw *other kinds of lines*.

Here's another example of my superior line-skills:

[Look at 'em skills and burn with jealousy](https://preview.redd.it/mstskgyi77d71.png?width=1570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b988d3bf2c072f6e219e4dd7b95547e1bdd5ab4)

Here you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we're now not in ***that*** downward channel. Which means we **can't possibly** go down anymore. Again: $100/share imminent. Furthermore, the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support. Bruh, it just do get more bullish than this. 

Except if I do this:

Here, I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case. In this world, when the price gets back up to the red dashed line, it will be promptly rejected to $0. But I own this stock and this outcome doesn't make me any money, so for ***reasons*** this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality.

**Part 3. Donkey Dicks**

Now, I've never done DD on anything until *after* I bought it. Thus, in keeping with tradition I've taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40%. In short, it's ***basically shit.*** 

Someone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen, like: **disruptor, innovator, AI, machine learning, tech, growth, next-gen**, etc. Dude, these guys sell insurance to old people. Worse, they only sell one kind of insurance: Medicare Advantage. Will they make money in the future? Yeah, sure. But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days. You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self-driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat. You're high, but it is *technically* possible. Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base. And the government has their hand in the mix. 

""But their saving the government money with their ***software platform***!"" 1) The government doesn't actually give a fuck about saving money. If the past two years taught you nothing else, I hope this at least got through. 2) Calling a computer program a 'software platform' doesn't make it anything more than a program where you input information. Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel? I doubt it, but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect. It just looks like advertising to me; kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with 'app' in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone. Whatever, before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage, I'm going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I'll never get the chance to click those buttons. 

CLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers, e.g., United Health Care (UNH). UNH has a market cap *literally* 100x CLOV, and yet people are like ""CLOV totally ***deserves*** to be valued like UNH."" UNH has an income of $14.5**B**. CLOV is at -$55**M**. Even sitting at a market cap of $395**B**, UNH is only running a p/e of 27.6, with a forward p/e 19.4. They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank, thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon. You can point at the 80/20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spirally cost of health care in America and I'll nod my head and agree, but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day. They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs, in my opinion--assuming they have any effect at all. 

""But Clover is growing at ***double digits***!"" It's easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers. After 2023, I believe the estimate is 5-7% per year. It's not terrible, but it's not going to take you to the moon. If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys, then okay, there's some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around. But I've as much chance of snorting lines off the titties a Victoria's Secret model while raw-dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht... anchored off the pristine white sand beaches of my new private island.

&amp;#x200B;

* too much publicity

WSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?

* too many new wannabe autists

WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.

* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets

Anyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to fix this?**

1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.
2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.
3. GME to the moon
4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.
5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.

*obligatory: I eat crayons dipped in paste and nothing here should be taken as financial advice. if you make any investment decisions based on what you read here, expect to lose money. you have been warned.*

Looking at the recent market shenanigans, the price action, you damn dirty apes investing heavily in this ex-blockbuster-esque company that ***I*** intend to own, aaand the way short sellers / big fish / hedgies are using GME to engage in their pissing contests... I've finally figured out how this shit's gonna go. And you better believe I'm poising myself to acquire this company in the process.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Here's how this is about to shake out with GameStop in the coming weeks/months:

- **The stock ain't going smoothly over $350.** When and if it does... Get ready for the planet to get knocked off its axis. $350 is apparently a magic number Melvin and the shorters are *terrified* of. Not sure why, but each time we get too close, their strategies go from what can only be described as ""Absolute Unfair Horseshit"" to ""Fuck It, Burn Everything to the Ground"" in a split second. They probably think everything they've been doing in between Feb 2nd and yesterday was ""playing nice."" Well, if Melvin wants to play that way, fine. I'll be positioning myself to make out like a BANDIT if this thing never breaks $350 again. Say goodbye to what little liquidity remains. It's all gonna be mine. I'll even take all of those shares they seems to be pulling out of thin air to borrow. It's yoinkin' time.

- **She ain't Fallin under $200 again pre-squeeze.** Somewhere in the range of $200-250 seems to be the new floor. This might be because of you diamond hand apes do not budge when your portfolio goes down 50-90%, or maybe it's because a shit ton of whales we don't even know about are sitting on massive limit buys, should it drop again. Either way, I think it's pretty clear that we are hanging out up here for a while. Which is... Fine. It's a bit expensive for me to throw more real life money at it haphazardly, but since I'm gonna be making my consistent moves in the range of $200-350, you better believe I got price traps in place all the way down from $200 to $50. And if it ever drops to or below $50 again, I'm just gonna get reckless buying with real life money. Doubt this will happen though, as it seems a lot of folks with more money to risk (and shorter term plans) are gonna catch the hell out of any dips. My business is picking up, and my accountant verified what I am doing in the market is basically a totally legal cheat code. So game on.

- **GME shareholders will look more and more like a cult (again).** This should come as no surprise. Last round they took weeks to slide the stock value from $200 to under $40 (bad move, baby) and apes held together strong. All the paper hands pissed off and joined thetagang or gamestopmeltdown and those who remained vigilant have been rewarded. No matter what happens now, even if it goes to $1/share, most of y'all are gonna take those to your grave. Only way out is up, and the further they press it down the more devout the apes become (only this time, I'm here. Drinking Melvin's milkshake with my verrrry long straw).

- **The squeeze will happen, or I will own GameStop.** Either one will happen, or both will happen. But it is mathematically impossible for neither to happen. This strategy formed after weeks and weeks of watching GME drop after Feb 2, staring at every play retail investors could make, and realizing the **only** people capable of making money on that particular price action were short sellers (IV was high, but the stock didn't move quite fast enough for puts to print, selling calls to outpace the loss of value holding shares, or even CSPs to result in a profitable outcome)... The way I'm playing options and shares to amass all shares in the market is literally *accelerated* by the very short-seller-profiting bullshit that went down Feb 2nd to Feb 22nd.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Mark my words.** The only way I fail is if GME rockets past $350 between now and April, and stays there.

tl;dr - Looks like it's just ???????????s, Short Sellers, and Hedge Funds / Whales now. Get ready for ""stagnation"" in GME price (high volatility sideways trading). Anything but up will help me accomplish my goal.

Y'all win or I win. The only people who are guaranteed to lose are the short sellers.

I am a palantir autist, aka, i've actually used foundry for 2-3 years at old workplace. I thought I'd write a piece to explain technically what it does, so you can feel more comfortable holding the bags and continue your confirmation bias.

# What is Foundry?

Foundry aggregates data from disparate systems and then allows non-technical users to combine, correlate, and chart it in many different ways. Here are how it works:

# Connect Data-Sources or upload data

Palantir uses a combination of Cassandra (for writing data quickly) and Parquet (for doing ad-hoc analysis) and SparkQL which helps do distributed data computing. I am not a data nerd, I don't understand this well, but it's much better than trying to do it yourself and getting eaten by Apache Alligators.

Enterprise users give authentication string to the Palantards, and they do either a pull or push from that data-store into Cassandra, which then writes it all over the place. Data analysis is done w/ Map-Reduce and Parquet tables to be ZOOOOOM.

I've seen people connecting p. much anything, whether it's Structued Query Language, Mongo, Comma-separated Value files (Automod didn't like the abbreviation), logs, excel spreadsheets, images, html, whatever. Can't say that it's a good idea connecting a bunch of these, but whatever we don't choose what garbage our employers like having their numbers and words in.

Anyway, data goes *PSSHHH* into Cassandra, Parquet goes *BRRR* and do SPEEDY data thing.

# Cleaning data using Blacksmith or code (Python or Apache Spark)

Okay, data is in AWS Parquet stores, but generally it sucks dick. Few examples of why it sucks:

* Country Code: US, USA, America, United States, US of A, MURIKA
* Name: Ree Tard, ReeTard, Ree, ree, Mr Ree Tard, Lord Ree\`Tard
* Date: 01/10/2021, 10th October 2021, 01/10/2021 (European though!)

So on, what this means is your data is super shit quality on ingestion. So you gotta write some code to look through all that data and make it Pristine *TM*. Nobody wants to make a chart seeing where all the retards who buy PLTR are from, and find that there are 40 variations of USA.

So you can do this with code, or something called Blacksmith. Blacksmith literally drag and drop simple web-ui click click delete garbage data, remove empty rows, format everything, replace dumb strings, etc.

Code gotta write stuff like.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img g4dubmm6m6c61...*

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like ""Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks"". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your ""I have all data in one view"" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click &gt; INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img g4dubmm6m6c61...*

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like ""Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks"". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your ""I have all data in one view"" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click &gt; INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

Let's look at GameStops current metrics.

GameStops current market cap at $90 is $6.5bil.

On last earnings, GME reported $1bil in revenue with -$18mil in net income.

They made $1,000,000,000 in revenue in 3 months, and they need to save $18,000,000 per quarter to turn a profit. Any improvements they make to the operations is going to keep pushing them farther into the green. They couldn't do much worse than last year with the pandemic...

...but instead they are about to have their largest quarter in recent history. Hear me out...

Between the dual-release of the PS5 and the XBOX, console sales will be a huge boost. But that is expected...

The other new market that no one is discussing is Trading Cards. Pokemon and Magic TCG both had a HUGE year. With card shops being shut down, a very large amount of sales went through GameStop because scalpers were clearing out big box retailers.

And GameStop takes pre-orders for them.

My local GameStop put a limit on 20 pre-orders per person so that they could try to guarantee allocation. 20 per customer... And they had to limit it...

GameStop has extra cash in the bank from the PreOrders for the next Shiny Vault Pokemon set coming out... So they actually have cash on the books in advance for this upcoming earnings report. You're going to see a huge surprise.

Their new partial owner, Ryan Cohen, took Chewy up against Amazon and won. And he brought his best team with him to GameStop. GameStop did 35% of their revenue through online sales in October. Wait until RC streamlines it and builds a market around the brand name recognition...

So ask yourself...

Does a $6bil cap company with $1bil in Quarterly Revenue (quarterly...), on the cusp of turning a profit, and with the best online sales team in the market sound like a decent investment to you?

Because that is what GameStop at $90 is...

Hold on my fellow Lennys. The long term looks good from here. $100 is going to be a floor soon. Sky's the ceiling...

Even without a squeeze...

Because of this the price is going down and some people start to panic and sell their shares (Fuck\*ng ???¯????). It also trigger stop loose (this is why you should turn them off.)

With that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. Iƒ??ll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers.

1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? Weƒ??ve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions arenƒ??t going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards?

2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? Iƒ??ve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if Iƒ??m wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze?

3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? Theyƒ??re obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So theyƒ??ve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares?

4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but canƒ??t read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and havenƒ??t had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. Whatƒ??s going to happen going forward with RH?

5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME?

Thatƒ??s all I got for now. Iƒ??ll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions arenƒ??t relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard.

 Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. blasted off Tuesday, again, as the retail crowd defied, with renewed vigor, another Wall Street analysts warning that investors sell because of unrealistic valuations.

The stock BBBY, +51.10% was down as much as 4% about a minute after the open, before doing an abrupt about-face. The meme stock soared 57.7% in very active midday trading, and has now more than doubled (up 138%) in three days. It has skyrocketed 450% over a 14-day stretch in which it rose in 13 of the days.

 Trading volume exploded, to reach a record for the stock of188.3 million shares, before noon Eastern. The stock was halted twice for volatility in morning trading.

B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson cut her rating to sell from neutral while affirming her $5 stock price target, which implies about 80% downside from current levels.

She said the downgrade comes after the stock (BBBY) has skyrocketed even after the home goods retailer reported very weak fiscal first-quarter results that led to the ouster of its chief executive officer.

 **B. Riley Has Cut Its Rating To Sell for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Due to 'Unrealistic'** **Valuation** 

A B. Riley analyst downgraded Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) from Neutral to Sell on valuation.

The analyst also reiterated a $5 per share price target that implies a downside risk of almost 70%. The move lower on the rating scale comes after BBBY shares rose more than 3x since the end of July.

She attributes this buying frenzy to Wall Street Bets Reddit forum.

ƒ??We believe that BBBY is currently trading at unrealistic valuations,ƒ? she said in a client note.

However, the analyst also sees positives in the recent run-up in shares as it could provide the company ƒ??a long-term lifelineƒ?.

ƒ??Prior 'meme stocks' including GME and AMC have used their prior boosts to raise capital through an at-the-market (ATM) offering to help generate cash,ƒ? the analyst added.

Cash generation is crucial for BBBY as the company is ƒ??facing fundamental issues with its business including declining liquidity and concern around the upcoming August 2024 $300M note with approximately $285M left to repay,ƒ? she concluded.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to ""stick it to the big guys.""  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

I have seen a fuckload of people comparing the VW squeeze to the GME squeeze and heres why that is an absolutely retarded thing to do:

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Time and Tech**

* I don't think this REALLY needs to be said, but the VW squeeze happened in 2008. GME squeeze is happening in 2021. There are some key differences here:
   * Quicker trades:  Back in 2008, online brokerages were really just beginning, with a low number of users. That means that things went quite a bit slower than they do now. Instead of months, this squeeze will take weeks. 

**2) Players**

* **Retail was not significantly involved in the VW squeeze.** We are seeing massive swings in price because retail is involved, buying, and more importantly **selling** significantly. Also, retail trading of GME calls is leading to increased volatility that just wasn't there in the VW squeeze. **Therefore, comparing the chart of the VW squeeze to the GME chart is just retarded.** 

**3) Ratio of shares sold short to available shares**

* **The GME squeeze CANNOT and WILL NOT be bigger than the VW squeeze for one reason: MATH.** In the VW squeeze, the ratio of Available shares to Short shares was 1:12. This means that for every share that was available to cover with, 12 were sold short. **This IS NOT, and NEVER HAS been the case with gamestop. At its peak, gamestop had a ratio of 1:2.56 of available float, and roughly 1:1.07 total float.** 
   * Knowing this, mathematically the GME squeeze WILL NOT BE GREATER than the VW one. we will likely see it top off at around 3-500 Maximum. 
      * Yes, I know that the VW squeeze could've gone higher if it hadn't been for people helping them out of their short positions, but they were in an entirely different situation with a ratio of 1:12 than any of the shorts are with a ratio of 1:2.56 (maximum)

I could go more in depth with this, but I'm not going to. hopefully you guys can understand it. 

**TL:DR: GME squeeze IS NOT the VW squeeze and they really** ***CANNOT BE COMPARED ON ANY INTELLECTUALLY HONEST MERIT.*** 

Comparing the two charts ""guys we are just in the dip, HOLD!!!11!"" is **PURELY CONFIRMATION BIAS and should be taken with a grain of salt.**",Comparing the GME squeeze to the VW squeeze needs to stop.,44221.49259,t3_l4uhms,"Comparing the GME squeeze to the VW squeeze needs to stop.

While this tweet is now deleted, as Burry frequently wipes his Twitter, it led me down a hole which I believe to have discovered a golden opportunity. This ƒ??iron coffin lidƒ? of Japanƒ??s has been rumored to break free for a while now, but hasnƒ??t.

Yet, Burry believes the time has finally come. As such he is heavenly invested in Japanese corporations. 

An excerpt from Burryƒ??s tweet: ƒ??#ironcoffinlid opening? If so, the contents are the likes of which are never seen in the western world.ƒ?

This led me to find, $EWJ. An ETF consisting of **85% OF JAPANƒ??S STOCKS**. (Thatƒ??s a lot!). No, you didn't read that wrong. Not 85% of EWJ consists of Japanese stock, EWJ consists of roughly 85% of the investible universe of securities traded in Japan. 

Some of the top companies that they hold the majority of their equity in include:

**NINTENDO**

**SONY**

**TOYOTA**

**MITSUBISHI**

**TOKYO ELECTRON**

**SOFTBANK GROUP**

I mean wow, what a stacked top contenders list.

**Nintendo only has positive year after year growth**, and after the revolution of the Switch, they are back on their feet with eyes forward. 

**Sony only has positive year after year growth.** Sony is a company that pioneers technology in all aspects, video-games, TV, music, etc. 

**Toyota only has positive year after year growth.** I expect this to skyrocket as well as we transition to the age of EVs. *Earlier this week Toyota announced their electric vehicles are coming THIS YEAR. Toyota also recently partnered with PANASONIC to manufacture their batteries for said EVs.* 

**While Mitsubishi has had their ups and downs, we still see a net positive year after year return.** Mitsubishi is Japanƒ??s *LARGEST TRADING COMPANY. With HIGH POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IN 2022+ AS THEY MOVE INTO EVs AS WELL.*

**Tokyo Electron** **only has positive year after year growth**. Going from a penny stock to $100 in less than 5 years, Tokyo Electron is looking like a very serious worldwide company moving forward. Founded in 1963, Tokyo Electron has been a manufacturer of ***semiconductors***, technology for the future that they have been pioneering for 50 YEARS NOW. You know all the people spamming $ON on here? That is a semiconductor play as well. This is just a safer gateway into that industry.

**SoftBank Group only has positive year after year growth.** Softbank is *THE WORLDƒ??S LARGEST TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED VENTURE CAPITAL FUND, WITH OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL.* 

These 6 are simply a very small few of EWJƒ??s top holdings. As you can see the road ahead is bright, almost blinding. EWJ took a dip during COVID, but is now coming out of that hole stronger and faster. If we take a look at EWJƒ??s chart we can see a lot of consistent breakout patterns occurring recently, lining up with Burryƒ??s idea. 

Letƒ??s take a look at the covid dip:

![img](uzamwpn52rg61 ""
"")

As we can see in early 2020 when we saw covid happen, the 100-day average passed downward through the 20-day average, as we spiral down. **However, we then see one of the quickest recoveries ever during the pandemic** as already in April the 20 day average passes through the 100 day and we begin our flight to the moon.

I decided to snoop around WSB and see if anyone else was talking about this. I stumbled upon u/ThePoorLadƒ??s post where he also notes a breakout pattern. His image below:

As you can see, this week we have a very prevailing and very bullish staircase pattern, this following Burryƒ??s tweet, seems to be the beginning of EWJƒ??s true soar to 100+. 

The options for EWJ have little to no volume. They are cheap as fuck. This is a stock no one fucking knows about. It just seems like a random Japan ETF, ƒ??who would want to get in on that?ƒ? No one realizes what's about to happen, (except our boy Burry). This is a golden opportunity to get in before the crowd. 

Look at these **2023 LEAPS**, 20 FUCKING 23, and look how cheap they are.  

*Processing img k41hu75o2rg61...*

EWJ has gone up $30 alone in the past half-year, and that is without this ""iron coffin lid"" rising. In my opinion, EWJ will EASILY hit 105 in **2021, let alone 2022 or 2023**. Take a look at the rest of the call sheet, yourself, they are cheap as fuck. 

Earlier this week Financial Times posted an article talking about how Japanese stocks are climbing to their highest levels since 1991. The stars are all aligning.

Position: 2023 100C @ 105

**TLDR:** *Michael Burry believes Japanƒ??s iron coffin lid will open to the likes of things that the western world has never seen. $EWJ only has positive growth potential and is about to break out. Options are also cheap as fuck. Moon mission has already begun.*  *????*

LIVE EDIT: As I write this, the prices for some of these calls are sky rocketing, while still mantaining little to no volume. I just witnessed some 0.01 calls go up 2800% off EWJ going up 5 cents.

14039,Hold,GME,,DangerActiveRobots,lcov3l,25,153,"This isn't a political sub so I'm not going to get political. All I'll say is this: in America there are still a lot of people out of work due to the pandemic. There are a lot of people who are barely clinging on to their place of residence, who are struggling to buy food for their families, and who can't find employment because very few industries are hiring or even CAN hire (yes, you can get a job during COVID, I did it, but it's not easy even for someone with significant higher education).

For many months, many of these people have been slowly spiraling down, growing more and more desperate as the pandemic continues to prevent them from working. They didn't do anything to deserve to be in this position. They didn't make a bad decision and lose their job. They didn't commit a crime. They're victims of circumstance.

So a lot of these people heard about GME and saw some of the ludicrous gains that some people were making, and they probably thought to themselves: ""look, I've got $500 left to my name. I owe a year of back rent. I'm getting evicted the second the grace period for that ends, and I can't find a job. What does it matter if I lose this $500? Either I make a ton of money and can survive for a bit longer, or I get evicted next months instead of two months from now.""

I'm just saying, I don't blame them. Now sure, there were PLENTY of people who got in because of the hype, and because of greed. I'm one of them. If I had sold at the peak I would have made a tidy $20,000. As of now my entire account is worth less than $2,000, and I have a variety of other stocks as well. I'm just fortunate enough to be in a position of having a regular income, so I can write this off as a loss and move on with my life, but many people aren't so lucky.

So yes, there's something to be said for shaking your head at the bagholders, but please at least acknowledge that we don't live in normal times. With all the hype on WSB and in the media, who wouldn't want to get in on that when they've been barely scraping by for months and months now? I mean I have people on my Facebook every DAY asking for help or trying to sell literally lids for mason jars because that's all they have left in the world. Not to jerk my own chain, but I've given away a substantial amount of money to a few families in need over the last year because their fucking kids had to eat, or their furnace was out and you could literally see your breath in their house. I did what I could to make a difference in my community. Maybe what we need around here is a little more compassion. Call me a gay retard or whatever, but I'm serious. Not everyone still holding a bag is a greedy jerkoff like me. Many people were just very, very desperate and thought they had a chance to change their life in a desperate moment.","As tempting as it is to make fun of bag-holders and people who lost their shirt over this, can we at least acknowledge that under life's circumstances lately, taking a huge risk with a meme stonk may have actually been one of the only options?",44231.55075,t3_lcov3l,"As tempting as it is to make fun of bag-holders and people who lost their shirt over this, can we at least acknowledge that under life's circumstances lately, taking a huge risk with a meme stonk may have actually been one of the only options?

For starters, look into ""bear raids."" Just Google bear raids and you will see that they're (usually) pretty freakin' illegal. And if you've been a real wsb ??? who's been following what's going on (no, not that garbage on cnn, wsj, etc.) you'll see that what RH, the HF, etc did/still-doing is a transparently illegal bear raid.

Margin Requirements effect's both longs and shorts. It effects longs only if shares have been bought on margin and the account is overleveraged, like a true retard like me.  I think because of this lot of shares were also sold today, because the brokerage forced selling.  

Whats an Margin Account ?  (Info From Fidelity) 

A margin account lets you leverage securities you already own as collateral for a loan to buy additional securities. 

What's a Margin Requirement 

Margin requirements tell you how much equity you must have in your account to cover what youƒ??re buying (or what you hold) on margin. The requirements are determined 

1. Federal Requirement . Default Value is 50 percent . Means for 10k account I can only leverage 5k more. For a total account of 15k.  
2. Exchange Requirement . Exchange Requirement is 25 percent 
3. Broker Requirement.   Ranges from 30-100 percent 

I will explain this using my Margin Account.    Below is the my margin  account and the house call which I almost got fucked with. Had to deposit 27k to cover it.

On 1/14/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was 40 percent.  

  

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (40%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|20,4000|30,600|

Like I true retard I used this 30,600 to buy other shares in the above screenshot.  I bought PLTR, GOEV etc.   

On 1/15/2021 the requirement for GME on Fidelity was changed to 65 percent.  Suddenly the leverage amount dropped for me from 30k to 17k.  Creating a short fall of 12.5k . As I was leveraged to tits I got a email from fidelity regarding this.  I got saved by rising GME price. 

&amp;#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|

Thankfully price of GME rose from 20 to 31 which increased my total account value and helped in avoiding margin call.  

&amp;#x200B;

On 1/15/2021 Fidelity and others increase there margin requirement to 85 percent or 100 percent in case of schawb. Suddenly all longs holding shares in margin account and tits leveraged and shorts are fucked.   I was suddenly down 17,850-7650 =10,200k. I got a house call/margin call.  As 1/15 was a bear day and my other stocks lost money suddenly I was in red of 23k. 

&amp;#x200B;

|Number Of Shares|Total Value |Requirement Amount (65%)|Leverage Amount|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3000|51,000|43,350|7650|

 In case of Margin call people have two options to either deposit $ or sell securities. 

I am depositing 27k to cover this shortfall if not I would sell some GOEV and NVAX to cover the shortfall.  In short people have opportunity to cover there margin call and the account is liquidated only when the call is not met or the broker decides the trade is retarded and sell it himself.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : Margin Requirement will cause both long and short to cover and it will also cause some longs who are leveraged to tits to sell the stocks.   This will effect shorts more as they are even more fucked than a long.

&amp;#x200B;

I see a lot of people shitting on AMC for being framed a ""scape-goat"" for GME shorts to divert us from GME.

There is no doubt that short squeeze is apparent in GME but let me explain why AMC shorts can also get FUCKED by recent events.

# 1. AMC Has a High Short Interest % [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

AMC is #2 on the list with a whopping 78.97% of float being shorted. and looking at the % held by institutions( 37.24% ) and assuming that these institutions are long on the stock, we're looking a short to float percentage of about **116.21%.** 

If this is not enough to cause a short squeeze I don't know what will.

# 2. AMC Got 2 Big Unexpected News.

Just like how Ryan Cohen's involvement has started this crazy investing phenomena, AMC has also receive a bunch of unexpected news that caught the ears of boomer investors. 

Recently it has received a lot of funding to not go bankrupt and even wiped off their debt by diluting shares. This was a great move as many investors will be looking forward to hop in for brighter prospect of the company. Plus with the vaccines being released AMC will get back on their feet in no time. Also, since they recently raised money by diluting shares and wiping away their debt, there won't be more share dilution in the near future.

Lastly, with the whole GME scandal, it received soooo much coverage on media and the public  which is only going to hurt the shorts. 

# 3. New Shorts are In The House

If you look at [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc) and [https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) The shares available to short has gone down significantly. JUST 4 days ago the short availability was at **7 million** and now this morning it went all the way down to **500**(0 on fintel). 

This means a lot of shorts possibly jumped in due to the recent jump in the stock price. However, what they don't realize is that this is an unprecedented time where millions of retailers are buying the stock to HOLD...because they like the stock. Not to bring down corrupt hedge fund fuckers of course. 

# 4. GME Steam Has Cooled Off a Bit

I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this last point but, personally, I think GME has potentially gone up to a point where retailers are not hopping in as much because of the high stock price but the ones who already got in are holding/adding to force the shorts to cover. This could explain why it really hasn't moved all that much in the past 2 days(except when it went down to like $132) despite people saying there will be a gamma squeeze today.

AMC is sitting at $13.00 as of now and it is at a relatively more ""desirable"" price for normal people to hop in. Psychologically it FEELS better to hold 30 stocks than 1 stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not suggesting you should sell GME and buy AMC but I can see about 5x return on AMC and about 3x return on GME in the near future. and I like to make more money so my money goes to AMC.

First, all you diamond hands are hereby promoted to Lt. Colonel after today. All you paper hands should be ashamed with yourself, but you still have time to help your fellow brothers against the Big Bad, Melvin Capital.

**Context**

Melvin Capital was bailed out today\[1\]. They were close to liquidating their position but were rescued. This is supported by the fact that as GME passed the 115 gamma ramp and headed to 150, the rest of the market was going red, likely from Melvin liquidating. This could have caused a cascading effect across other funds an positions, but that's another post. What is evident was that Melvin Capital was likely about to start liquidating but was rescued by Plotnik's Papa Steve Cohen with 2.75B \[1\]

**Conjectures**

I'll describe how Melvin Capital will likely try to countermove their weak position. Everything I write is conjecture, and would be a very low investable thesis but let's continue with the white boarding.

The GME 60C is the beginning and the end for you guys. Huge amounts of call buying and delta hedging occured at this strike. 10s of Millions of shares are linked to these derivatives.

Melvin's Capital goal is to not be forced into a short squeeze. You guys want the the infinite short squeeze to be triggered. MM/Citadel Securities provides the price discovery on how expensive each countermove is for the actors in this game.

Melvin Capital is likely not to double down on naked shorts with the new funds because if he loses in that move, Plotnik's career is over and may face criminal charges for abusing his fudiciary duties by doubling down with more naked short selling.

We saw today how someone forced GME share price to drop over 10% and force halts, thereby dropping off vega and killing off any gamma ramping. It happened over and over. So we know that's what they tactically want to do.

Steve Cohen's, famous hedge fund manager, has a favorite play. He would create massive call and put walls around a strike price to kill off vega and prevent gamma, and collect premium. In ELI5, Cohen would put up massive blocks of expensive puts and calls so that participants would have to churn through them before gamma could be ramped. By the time it happened, theta would have made your positions not profitable. And Cohen would collect the premium as actors tried to hammer through those put and call walls. He basically does this to kill volalitity.

Plotkin was Cohen's right hand man.

So expect Plotkin will use the 2.75B to drive GME price below 60, then he will ressurect massive put/call walls around a strike price and wait out the ITM 60C options across the calendar. This will kill vol and dampen gamma to prevent a gamma squeeze that can trigger an infinite short squeeze.

**Retails counter move**

Retails only chance is to have a big whale on your side to blast threw those put/call walls that will kill vol; or it's a race against time to trigger the gamma squeeze before Plotkin drives the price below 60 and erects the massive put/call walls that make all the ITM 60C expire worthless and dampens anymore gamma ramping to force a short squeeze.

Retail must drive GME to 115 and soon

Everyone complains that we get posts after a stock makes it move, but here is your heads up for next week on Thursday, March 31. Blackberry is not a handset manufacturer anymore. It is a Cybersecurity, self-driving and IoT juggernaut. While everyone is discounting this company, it has been on a tear transforming itself using the best talent in Cybersecurity. 

They derived $128MM of their $184MM revenue last quarter from Cybersecurity. That is 69% for you meme lovers. The rest was from licensing, IoT and self-driving tech.  

Wars of 50ƒ??s were fought and won on the ground. Wars of 80ƒ??s were fought and won in the air. Wars of tomorrow will be fought and won in the Cyber. We are already seeing an uptick in Cyber-warfare from Russia. I am not buying Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, ƒ?? I am buying BB April 9th 7.5 strike calls.

Here is some of the highlights of what blackberry has been up to:

* BMW Group enters multi-year agreement to use BlackBerry QNX?? technology to develop SAE Level 2/2+ driving automation functions in multiple makes and models across the BMW group.
* Exabeam, the leading next-gen SIEM provider, partners with BlackBerry to greatly expand access to telemetry data from 100ƒ??s of network devices as part of its enhanced BlackBerry?? Guard managed extended detection and response (XDR) service. 
* Okta and BlackBerry announce a comprehensive partnership to deliver both seamless identity and access capabilities while using BlackBerry UEM?? endpoint management, as well as integrating Oktaƒ??s telemetry data into BlackBerryƒ??s XDR platform.
* BlackBerryƒ??s leading prevention-first cybersecurity technology prevents high-profile malware and ransomware including DanaBot, Raccoon Infostealer, SquirrelWaffle, Jennlog Loader, and more. 
* Google and Qualcomm join forces with BlackBerry QNX to reduce developer friction and time to market when virtualizing Android Automotive OS alongside safety critical applications on the QNX?? Hypervisor.
* SE Labs, a leader in independent cybersecurity research, ranks BlackBerry as the best new endpoint security offering of 2021.
* FINAL STAGES of all these developments:

Regardless of what you think of the company's future, MOASS, the cult-like hopium echo chamber, etc when looking at the chart over the past year, it's really hard to deny that there has been some cyclical price movement.  And guess what, we're in the process of making another run, as expected based on previous cycles.   Some nice green dildos so far this week with Tuesday +13% and Wednesday +7.5% but have no fear,  you haven't missed your chance to yolo in you fucking degens.

Take a look at this very dumbed down chart:  [https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5IHrw0g.png)

All I'm trying to show here is the approximate 60-trading day cycle that we can track over the past year from peak to peak. It's important to note that the sneeze last January was not tied to any of these cycles.   Based on the 60-day cycle, the current run will peak around 2/18, which is in line with a big OPEX clearing date.  What happened around this time last year?  how about the stock more than doubling over a 2 day period.  If we can break the year-long trend and run into OPEX, a  significantly larger move up is possible.

While the stock is the lowest it's been in quite some time, it's primed for a big move thanks in part to the options chain.

Here's some fun options activity from today:  [https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png](https://i.imgur.com/5hkr52g.png)

Some  pretty nice call buying pressure coming in.   The put/call ratio has  flipped to heavily favor calls, both in volume and premiums.

Ortex Data:  [https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png](https://i.redd.it/fmwok3vxitg81.png)

Considering  short positions are self-reported and I don't really trust Ortex data  this all has to be taken with a giant fucking grain of salt but it's  interesting to note that over the past month cost to borrow and  utilization is the highest they've been since before last January with  utilization reaching 100% today. There are some interesting theories as  to why we're seeing this now but that's too complicated for me and not  important to the point i'm trying to make.

**$RKT NOT SQUOZE YET AT ALL***

There's just some facts I want to point out and please correct me if I'm wrong: donƒ??t downvote if ur just a hater, downvote if my research doesnƒ??t add up

Since the beginning of space exploration, the concept of going to the moon (or beyond) has never been done without a rocket. I don't need to put the ticker ($RKT) because there's some weird (non-existent) war being waged between game stoppers and rocket launchers.  FOR NO REASON!


1) $RKT got crushed yesterday, meaning there is an SSR in effect (I went to the Nasdaq site and didn't see it so please clarify). If there isn't - who cares.

1a) see 5)

2)  The fact of the matter is that [30 million shares were sold short yesterday](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210303.txt). Meaning it was shorted all the way down. By who? By us? By hedges? Who cares. 

2a) as of right now (5pm March 4th ) [RKT has second highest short %](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=131&amp;amp;f=cap_smallover,geo_usa,sh_avgvol_o500,sh_curvol_o500,sh_opt_optionshort,sh_price_o3,sh_relvol_o1,sh_short_high&amp;amp;o=-shortinterestshare) 


3) The market today is a disaster in its entirety due to the US Treasury and shaky paper hands everywhere. They say it's meme stocks but only difference these losers just print money, and make the rules. **We are the real traders**

4) There was a big 2.2 million buy right at open that sent the stock flying, my trading sen-sei verified this, according to lvl 2 data and I'm thinking this was institutional - it wasn't RIGHT at open. You can literally see it at Mkt open. 

5) The spaceship hasn't really gone down significantly. It didn't crash and burn like SpaceX's. This is on a very bad day in the market overall and lots of tension. It went down to 25-ish briefly and shot back up. Our rocket has not crashed and burned and held up quite well after a 70+% increase. If there was no SSR today, then wtf itƒ??s definitely bottomed. 

6 (and the most important - toronto man): The dividend pays out $1.11 per share to every holder of the stock on March 9th. If a 2.2 million share buy sent the share put the price up, imagine when retail (and more institutions) buy in ahead of March 9th. Share buyback too?

14331,Hold,GME,,ferrellhamster,lff0y0,102,433," I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river. 

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)) 

* If EV&gt;0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do. 
* If EV&lt;0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it. 

  
  How do we apply this to GME? Well, you need to know the current price, the worst outcome you see possible, the likelihood of that happening, and have a target exit point (the moon is rumored to be at $69,420, but that's just in fables and may differ from person to person). I'll give an example using one positive outcome and one negative outcome to keep things simple. 

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

ƒ??SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!ƒ?

 ƒ??YEEAHHH!ƒ? -Lloyd Christmas

  
Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and how I am looking at it. Do your own DD.

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think about.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices &amp; target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",A Gambler's Guide to GME.

Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and how I am looking at it. Do your own DD.

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think about.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices &amp; target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",gambler guide GME use expected value help make decisions financial advisor financial advice gambling money need survive acting irresponsibly speculative part position still true post referring speculative portion expected value anticipated value investment speculation point future calculate positive outcomes multiplied likelihood occurrence negative outcomes multiplied likelihood occurrence perceived expected value number negative better getting cutting losses gamblers win making positive decisions even sometimes nuts turn fish flops flush river expected value total negative outcomes likelihood occurrence total positive outcomes likelihood occurrence hold FOLD might consider buying funds stand lose grey area really making big mistake matter accept lost time cut losses fold honestly appraisal situation sell yes said apply GME well need know current price worst outcome see possible likelihood happening target exit point moon rumored fables may differ person person give example using one positive outcome one negative outcome keep things simple speculative portion amount already put sunk cost paid share share amount gone look price today simplicity let say right let say think lowest stock due favorable coverage impressions among zoomers millenials primary demographic along news new internetsavvy hires chewy guy negative outcome represents drop target price let say representing gain example current price likelihood hit idk let say estimate chance happening first loss current level likelihood gain likelihood expected positive assumptions hold fabled gon write math turns perceived breakeven chance fail versus chance succeed level thought chance succeeding greater least hold position RE telling chance yeeahhh lloyd christmas someone might tell assumptions wrong drop less likely presented could less fair might wrong looking looking anyway hope puts things perspective hedge funds want fold hand lowest point possible positive afford gamble stock market let say speculate things think tldr based assumptions worst case scenarios estimated likelihood along side current prices amp target goals make mathbased decisions whether sell hold,GME

This is not financial advice. I simply am sharing why I like this stock. 
I also support GME AMC and WISH.

CLOV is one of the fastest growing health care companies. It has recently applied to double its Market outreach. This can double its gains. They are aiming to grow into 109 new counties. They are also constantly growing. 

Some important facts I would like to share in why I think this company has so much potential.

I think this company is the best of both worlds (fundamentals and meme world). Fintel has this as the #1 stock to short squeeze!

This stock is very manipulated. Hindenburg and shorts destroyed this stock a few months ago from 16 all the way down to 6! Itƒ??s finally getting back on its legs. Hit as high as 27-27 a few weeks ago with only a fraction of shorts covering. The shorts are once again at all time highs!

The cost to borrow is also starting to significantly increase: currently at 55%. This is how GME started to get insane rips last year.

Fellow APES, DO NOT MISS THE ROCKETSHIP!

POSITIVE CATALYSTS for CLOV!!

1. Extremely high SI (48%+)
2. The CEO and owners canƒ??t sell until stock shares until CLOV hits above 30$ for an average of 90 days. Stock is currently at 12.97.
3. Recently joined MCSI index and had a nice run up.
4. ZERO DEBT, 700 million cash, unlike AMC, no risk of dilution!
5. Available shares to short almost done: 100K as of this post and BORROWING rate going up currently 55%!!
6. They beat earnings last month but a great amount and are constantly expanding. They will be very profitable.
7. Partnership with Walmart and many other great companies. 

So many new apes taking positions!

""Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio. As I said, we cover three major areas; cellular, wireless communications and networking. So things that is relevant but it's not useful to us today in our strategic software part of the business and we retained all the embedded and all the site ends and all the encryption and security technology patent."" - John Chen

* John Chen suggested there will be a large portions of the patents being sold, out of the 38,000 patents owned by BB. From an article suggested in 2013, the patents owned by BB are worth a good $2bil - $3bil, but there was some sold to Huawei which might either take a small nip out of this according to the reports. Potential inflation of these patents could be considered.

"" So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years. So it will not go away to zero, there are some recurring -- that most of them will not be with us. But, so it will not be zero, but it will be quite small, if this happens -- sales go through with one big year in this fiscal year 2022. If the patent sale does not go through, then the first couple of quarters will be low, because if the pattern sale is being negotiated right now, I actually are unable to do more other negotiation going on. So the pipeline basically is frozen, but it won't go away. So if the patent sale does not go through, I may have to suffer a little bit for the first couple of two, three quarters and then we will then assume the target 250 a year patent licensing."" - John Chen 

* Patent licensing makes up 100M which is fairly a large amount of money. But let's say they do sell it, $BB get one big payment for one quarter, and installments for up to 7 years (seems to be the current terms of negotiation). Also it seems like there could also be a possibility the sell does NOT go through at all or negotiations won't be down for a few quarters.
--&gt; If they do sell this, assuming they will sustain some other products and services? As this constant selling of their own product revenue isn't sustainable. 

""The company limits its licensing activities in the quarter due to the negotiations and because of accounting rules which Steve will explain later."" - John Chen
""Further to John's comments regarding negotiations relating to a potential sale, licensing activities have been limited not only due to the ongoing negotiations, but also because revenue from additional transactions that could have been completed in the quarter would have been treated as contingent revenue and deferred to future periods. Therefore, had negotiations not been in progress, we believe licensing revenue would have been higher."" - Steve Rai

20709,Buy,CRSR,,BIGYOUBS,o5x1ut,46,216,"Hello, fellow apes. This sub has been bringing up one of my favorite stocks right now, **CRSR**, which although undervalued by almost any metric (the street target is sitting at about $47 - right above ATH and 50% upside) yet has been trading flat in the low 30s range. I want to talk about why it stayed so steady, why this makes it the PERFECT opportunity for entry (especially on leaps- low IV on the contracts, but short-term theta is a killer).  

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** Since CRSR IPO'd in 2020, it has done nothing but surprise investors. Posting its first profitable year, increasing revenues, and paying off debt. Not to mention they threw a few acquisitions in there to further diversify the business. Originally investors were amazed, which caused over a 200% rally in share price. 

**Why it's Flat:** Since then, the market has been too worried about the vaccines and reopening efforts hurting their sales. But as we have all probably realized over the past year and a half -  gaming, streaming, and building computers AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. If anything there are more consumers interested than ever before. CRSR has also taken steps to expand its business and establish itself as one of the biggest sponsors in streaming. Think of Nike or Red Bull - but for Esports. By growing their sponsored gamer teams, they attract the next generation of gamers and consumers who want to have the same products as their favorite gamers - the same way you still buy Jordans.

**Factors for Moon:** The most obvious is the fundamental undervaluation for CRSR. While most stocks keep pushing higher, CRSR has not seen love for months, even after posting great earnings at the beginning of May. While AMD has begun to rally and NVDA hits new ATH, people fail to realize that as they grow so does CRSR. What happens when NVDA or AMD comes out with a new product people buy? They get some CRSR accessories and peripherals to go with their new devices. The market is failing to see the amazing opportunity right in front of it.

**Let us not forget the 22% short interest ratio, which is why the rally last week couldn't hold. The rally also had 20x the average daily volume, if the market begins to realize CRSRs potential soon that type of volume will be normal, and so will a price between $45-$58 (my own targets from DCF model built).**

I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&amp;D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? Iƒ??ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so youƒ??d expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.
- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021
- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting
- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.
Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192
- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:
Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6%
Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%
Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2%
Insider Ownership 6.5%
Other 67.4%

Total of institution ownership:
12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%
Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors:
26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%
Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:
32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares
Shares needed to cover the records:
-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M
- Synthetic shares:
total number of synthetic shares: Z
naked shorts: X
naked call contracts: Y
other naked shares: W
Z = X + Y + W
Short interest:
Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares
Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records:
100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)
Hidden number of synthetic shares:
U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.
Minimum number of synthetic shares
37M + U
- Bottom line:
37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.

AMD having recently broken resistance at 50 is looking to scale even greater heights. Its lining up a very strong run-up for 2020, having ripped market share from Intel in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.  


Breaking down into points for all the illiterate:  


**POINT 1: APPLE CURRENTLY TESTING AMD CHIPS IN MACBOOK PROs**  
Developers have found snippets of code suggesting that Apple developers were testing AMD chips within the kits. [AMD new chips are almost exactly the multi-core solution](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-apple-should-ditch-intel-for-amd/) apple need and If this pans out they may replace Intel in the near future

This leads us nicely into the next point...

**POINT 2: APPLE WANTS TO DITCH INTEL**  
Intel has famously suffered from shortages leading to Apple blaming them in slumps in sale in [May 2019](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/apple-blames-intels-processor-shortage-for-slump-in-mac-sales). They still can't get their shit together and [cant even confirm  if they can meet 2020 production.](https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/intels-cpu-shortage-impact-chip-giants-pc-makers/).  
They even wrote an [apology letter.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-sorry-for-pc-chip-delays-but-we-just-cant-meet-demand-for-cpus/) Apple are looking to jump ship and AMD are starting to look like a luxury yacht. [Expect a JUNE 3rd Announcement at Apples Developers conference](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-may-start-selling-macs-with-amd-cpus)

**POINT 3: AMDs THREADRIPPERS ARE SETTING WORLD RECORDS**  
Overclockers are using [threadrippers to clock in 5,548.71MHz.](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-overclocked-at-55-ghz-is-setting-world-records) This is a day after release, with overclockers till continuing to tweak and optimize their rigs. Expect top tier sales from this bad boy from PC geeks worldwide

**POINT 4: AMDs are in BOTH the PS5 and in the XBOX Series X**   
Both console giants are will be utilizing [AMD processors in their consoles](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/could-amd-smartshift-be-the-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-secret-sauce-for-8k-gaming). What else do I have to explain? Its videogames everyone and their uncle is gonna have one.  


**POINT 5: AMD WILL STILL BE RELEASING COMPETITIVE GPUS (BIG NAVI) AND CPUS (ZEN3)**

Rumors of a GPU releasing March 3 (supposedly an RTX2080 TI Killer) have been circulating, we may not see this date but [Su BAE herself has confirmed a 2020 release](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/70025/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-confirms-see-big-navi-2020/index.html).  
[ZEN 3 Architecture was also confirmed by Queen Su](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-zen-3) and will upgrade the company's mobile offering substantially.

END OF POINTS  


Based on all the above, I believe AMD will see tremendous progress as a company and in its stock price. If it can survive any negative corrections, we may never see these prices again. If you want to YOLO on *actual* company doing disruptive things in its industry this is it.

Go to about the 7 minute mark in [this interview of Alex Karp ](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-palantir-ceo-alex-karp/vi-BB19Aen1) where he mentions Apollo:

&gt; We built this product which has gotten very little attention called Apollo. Apollo allows us to maintain and deliver software to any number of clients without essentially growing our Palantir force at all. So we're planning--now that we have Apollo--to grow the number of super cool customers all over the world, and we can do it all without raising headcount.

As he explains it, Apollo allows Palantir to:

&gt; deliver the whole stack in 6 hour [...] We can do this with a small number of people, sitting in our one office that we have, maintaining, updating, and providing them with the product that we build. So they don't have the Frankenstein's monster that takes 2 years to build, and has to be maintained with either human hours--like in gov contract case--or by purchasing new product, or compensating sales people or hiring new IT people that you don't even like talking to. You can actually buy one stack. 

And the last thing he mentions in the interview is a question regarding what happens if the world's internet splits apart into separate jurisdictions due to de-globalization: 

&gt; The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir.

#Apollo

So just what *is* Apollo? For one - [Apollo: Explained](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-apollo-powering-saas-where-no-saas-has-gone-before-7be3e565c379). The concept is actually pretty simple - here's the dumbed down version:

Most enterprise SaaS companies run on the public cloud and use a single cloud provider. 

Palantir software must run on a multitude of different clouds, including purpose-built government or classified clouds separate from standard public cloud, due to the need of their contracts. 

Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry seamlessly regardless of the type of cloud the end user's data operates on. In other words, Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry onto AWS, Azure, Google, or more unique clouds like CIA Cloud without needing to write individualized code for those deployments. 

Coupled with Palantir's familiarity with working on different unique end-user environments (which they had to do for the army with Gotham), they are essentially running a multi-cloud SaaS instead of a single-cloud SaaS.

As different countries start passing their own regulations on the internet--privacy, data sharing, etc., this will force SaaS companies serving different customers to adapt. 

Meanwhile, Palantir has already prepared for this inevitable outcome by developing Apollo: the continuous delivery system that enables multi-cloud SaaS on whatever cloud infrastructure available to them--public or private. 

**Remember:** Palantir's entire service is helping customers pull their data quickly and effortlessly. 

Boomer companies that acquired hot startups and need to integrate that data will most likely be operating on a multi-cloud environment. Same is true for a US-based internet company operating across the world where privacy and data collection laws may be more stringent.   

----

#Implications

In the Apollo article, it ends with:

&gt;  We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.

Now pair that up with what Karp said at the end of his interview:

&gt; The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir. 

The world is slowly but surely headed towards different internet blocs, with the EU enacting more stringent data protection laws, China with its Great Firewall, India using the power of periodic internet shutdowns and the push to develop more indigenous software talent, and Russia periodically talking about shutting itself off from the rest of the internet. 

This means multinational firms will eventually be forced to separate out their data in Europe, Japan, and the US. For companies that have already transitioned to the cloud, critical code could be held in entirely different countries and subjected to entirely different sharing laws. 

Palantir's software allows a viewer to *look* at only the pertinent part of the code through Foundry's prioritization of intent as part of its privacy features. But more importantly, Palantir can continue to deliver Foundry even as the laws continuously change and get refined. 

Furthermore, Apollo is also going to drastically cut back on the number of people that Palantir will need to hire to maintain their code. This further cuts down on the biggest cost - employee stock compensation - and allows Palantir to really start growing its profit margins even further on super sticky clients who continues coming back for more.

16907,Hold,BBBY,,Magnus56,wrbzxd,1,750,"At the time of writing, BBBY has lost \~19% value  (4.25 dollars) worth of value in after market close-. 

Why is this important? 

First, the after hours drop provides compelling evidence of outside forces putting influence on the value of BBBY. Such forces also may help offer an alternative explanation of the stocks decline, compared to, ƒ??People sold because RC did XYZƒ?. If, in fact, outside forces are pushing the value of BBBY down sharply, it is unlikely that these forces can maintain a significant downward pressure on the stock for long. This implies the stock will regain value readily, as the underlying fundamentals which make BBBY a good purchase are still true.

Second, the after hour drop shows that at least some within the financial industry are actively working against accurate BBBY valuation. How far do these efforts go? It's hard to say. During the GME saga, an article which described a catastrophic GME stock crash was published minutes *before* the crash. Thus, one can logically infer that at least some parts of the media are also conspiring to lower the value of BBBY. As such, a person would benefit from critical evaluation of any media pieces which discuss the potential future of BBBY. Notably, one of the most powerful weapons of the media has at itƒ??s disposal is Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD). FUD pushes us apes to doubt one another, FUD tells us that we will lose everything, FUD weakens our resolve to turn proud diamond hands to regretful paper hands. 

I have little doubt that tomorrow, multiple news outlets will publish pieces which describe the fall of BBBY as irrefutable evidence that the ƒ??Meme frenzyƒ? responsible for driving the value of BBBY has ended as suddenly as it started. As a veteran of the GME Saga, I have a different perspective. 

In World War II, as England was bombed by German planes which took off in the then occupied France, Winston Churchill addressed the besieged English nation over the radio. A gifted speaker, Winston Churchill told the people, ƒ??This does not mark the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginningƒ?. And we find ourselves in a similar scenario. I suspect the artificial drop in value marks the end of the beginning for BBBYƒ??s saga. In the near future, we will be bombarded by media pieces which attack almost every aspect of this subreddit. From the population composition, language use, beliefs, almost everything is fair game. Ultimately, the goal of these efforts is the same: Make us apes sell. The institutions which have shorted BBBY know that we can, and do have the power to bankrupt them.  The economist John Maynard Keynes once quipped that, ƒ??Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solventƒ?. Put another way, by banding together we can lock up the majority of unaccounted shares, which will put immense financial strain on these companies. In the GME saga, multiple elite  financial institutions were destroyed because of similar financial strains. The literal millions of shares of BBBY which were shorted by hedge funds promises to drain the coffers of hedge funds across the industry and threatens not just an institution's profits, but their existence.

How should we react? For myself, I chose to double down on our plan to hold as much stock as we can afford.

We know, from both market data and the strength of this coordinated strike that those on the hook for shorting BBBY are, rightfully, terrified.

8720,Hold,TLRY,,orfane,lg9ktu,245,1230,"All prices listed in USD. Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:** The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

* Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.

* Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor

* TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price. 

**This is not financial advice. It is just some things I thought you would like to know**",Some DD on TLRY/APHA since none of you seem to get it,44236.46944,t3_lg9ktu,"Some DD on TLRY/APHA since none of you seem to get it All prices listed in USD. Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:** The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

215m rev, expected 245.


BB's downfall has always been lack of revenue growth, and the reaction matched the results.

**However let's dig a bit deeper.**

They said that they're currently in the process of selling a large portfolio of **messaging** and communication patent profile, to a **north american** buyer

And hence under that stipulation, they stated that they were unable to generate revenue using those parents. That explains why they missed.


2. I did not expect a settlement from Facebook, however I do think this buyer could be Facebook, it would make sense if you look at the lawsuits that occurred between Facebook and BB, one of them was the ability to switch from having games inlay in a messenger ( FB messenger) which BB won. 


3. Expecting 9-15% GAAP growth in cyber sec, yes this isn't as much growth as CRWD but BB is worth 4-5b vs 40b for crwd.


They mentioned USPS, looking forward to more details about that. 


Notes:
I think even the fact they mentioned the patent sale on ER would indicate that they're in very advanced talks, or they would lose their negotiating power. 


Ivy partnerships will be announced later this year and be in cars by 2022, I already predicted this but a confirmation is nice.


Overall this quarter also saw one less competitor in McAfee

They're also putting more of an initiative in marketing and brand awareness. 


They have 800m in cash, 800-900m in revenue, valued at 4-6b. With potential for explosion via IVY and more cyber sec growth in the coming years.



I think there will be more negativity to come, especially from analysts that will want to flaunt their previous price targets, they will double down on that. 

I think this will present a nice buying opportunities for anyone that wants in the coming days.

Corsair likely needs little introduction these days, as their computer components find their way into a huge and increasing number of PC builds. Fans, radiators, keyboards, etc. Their products are great and the way the company is managed is just as good.

There is unfortunately not much long term data available on the company, as they only recently went public with an IPO in September 2020, when it [debuted at $15 a share](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/tech/corsair-ipo-ceo-interview/index.html). However I will do my best to analyze all the data about the company since then to prove Corsair has a great valuation as it currently sits at \~$32 a share.

As the above link states, Corsair had a revenue of 1.3 Billion ending in June 2020. Even through the first waves of the pandemic, with closures of factories everywhere, Corsair still managed to rake in cash, which they continue to do so. Using TD Ameritrade's platform thinkorswim, we can see revenue has still been growing since then, massively too. 

**Financials**

[TDA's Fundamentals on CRSR](https://preview.redd.it/nevpo4l6zw471.png?width=1595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1b53934b0273547dee788d0e07b7a98c259fa57)

There's alot to take in right there, but lets analyze their fundamentals.

* Revenue growth was estimated at 65.75%. For a company to see that much revenue growth during a time that production facilities across the world are shutting down is nothing short of amazing. And that's not all for growth during Covid.
* Earnings Per Share in the last twelve months is at $1.59, pretty good. What's even better is that this is a 108% increase in the EPS of last year.
* Book Value Per Share rose similarly, with a yearly increase of 50.39%, bringing it up to $4.76 BVPS.
* Gross and Net Profit Margins saw in increases of 30.76% and 112.62%, respectively.
* At the same time, the Debt to Capital ratio dropped through the floor, falling 65.03% to strengthen the company's balance sheet.
* Financial Leverage decreased by 62.71%, showing their effort in paying off loans on assets.

As for valuation, Corsair's P/E ratio, the most well known valuation ratio, is at 19.606. Relatively high, but most value investors consider a P/E below 20 to be the range for a decent value stock. On the other hand, P/C and P/B are at 21.299 and 6.2857, higher than desired for value stock considerations. While the P/C and P/B can be used as a counterargument to my thesis, I am willing to overlook these numbers because Corsair's massive growth during a global pandemic highlights that this company can be considered undervalued and a growth stock candidate.

Additionally, Corsair has nearly [doubled expected earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crsr/earnings) in 2 of the last three quarters. The numbers are as follows:

* Q3, 2020: Expected earnings of .26, actual was .52
* Q4, 2020: Expected earnings of .56, actual was .52
* Q1, 2021: Expected earnings of .34, actual was .56

This indicates Corsair's consistent results, with analysts underestimating the company's potential.

Now, lets look at a chart of CRSR.

**Previous 12 Months**

[Flat as a pancake](https://preview.redd.it/1sfmzvua9x471.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c243c5ead1888e7339ca7829b2e786764da180ca)

Now, I'm not personally one for technical analysis. I won't go in depth here, but anyone can see that in the last several months, the stock price has barely moved. down from a high of $51.37 per share in November 2020, it has settled at a stable \~$32 per share, rarely deviating more than a dollar in either direction. Part of this is because of the low volume in recent months. Since March 2021, volume has never gone below 500,000 and never above 4.8 million, with the 4.8 milllion figure being a significant outlier. In the past, Corsair has seen much stronger buy volume and can rise in price quickly, going from its IPO price of $15 in September 2020 to its ATH of $51.37 only two months later.

Why is this important? A stable stock price means low Implied Volatility. Low Implied Volatility means cheap options. IV is currently at 56.7%, and any increase in stock price above its resistance of $33 will see an increase in the price of all options. ATM weeklies can be as cheap as a $.37 premium per share for calls. LEAPS aren't terribly expensive either, although open interest on long term options is currently low.

**Looking Forward**

All this already sounds like a great investment, but as I previously mentioned multiple times, these numbers put up by Corsair were all during the Covid pandemic and it's factory shutdowns. As anyone who has tried to build a PC recently will know, semiconductor prices are through the roof currently because of [low supply](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/semiconductor-supply-shortage.html). GPU and CPU production is extremely slow right now, but just starting to pick up steam. Over the past year, [scalpers](https://www.pcmag.com/news/scalpers-have-sold-50000-nvidia-rtx-3000-gpus-through-ebay-stockx) have strangled the computer chip market and alot of people are straight up refusing to pay for these inflated prices. Once production is back in full force and consumers are building more PC's, peripheral sales will spike alongside them. This is where Corsair comes in. If they can put up spectacular growth numbers while a large part of the market sits and waits for prices on critical components goes down, think about what will happen when new AMD chips and NVIDIA graphics cards are being pumped out at breakneck paces, which will soon happen as vaccines are now allowing non essential businesses to ramp up production once again. Most analysts place the [price target](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRSR/price-target/) around $50, showing its strong upside.

**Conclusion**

Corsair is currently showing signs of both a good value investment and growth stock. They demonstrate a decent P/E ratio and increases in EPS, BVPS, revenue, and profit margin, alongside decreases in Debt to Capital ratio and Financial Leverage. The stock price is currently very steady at \~$32 a share, resulting in low IV and cheap options. As the semiconductor market warms back up as Covid subsides, Corsair sales will increase even more as more people build PC's with Corsair cases, mouses, power supplies, etc.

# Why didnƒ??t the cow go over the moon?

Simple really, about 8.2million shorts were unloaded and stopped the momentum.

[This many shares were borrowed.](https://preview.redd.it/v84vh1q22r471.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67961ae1d10f1ec612e97144009b893d86b6285d)

# What was the result of said shorting?

[Hourly recap of price action](https://preview.redd.it/t2c191ep5r471.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa1ba34e10e15719aa12a884bcc6cf77e2748875)

The shorts were unloaded, I think, at the peak of the overnight run up. That stopped the momentum for the +30,000 6/18 13c options being hedged. Mix in some ƒ??oh no,ƒ? and this is what you get. Worth noting: 8.2 million shorts caused a $6 dip. Iƒ??m sure a lot of that was stop losses for shares. With only 800,000 shares available, the stock should not fall much. Especially with a strong support at $9.79. If you have stop losses set, I donƒ??t know why you are even reading this **(Not financial advise)**.

# The TA you want to see

**The way I see it, we have a long-term trend that is moving up since.ƒ?? November 9th, 2020.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Long-term trend](https://preview.redd.it/w5cntxs56r471.png?width=2732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a1278a38252eff01c3585ca292f185c2326d912)

Thereƒ??s a lot to digest here so let me just piece this out. First, CLNE starts the bullish run on November 9th, 2020 and peaks about February 10, 2021. It then enters a bearish trend until about May 5th. That is when it reverses into the now bullish trend that we are excited for. To analyze these trends, I used two tools, Fibonacci Retracement and Fibonacci Time Zones. 

What are these?

Do they workƒ?? for CLNE at least? **Yes**

    Overviews from investopedia.

# Time Zones

[Fibonacci Time Zones](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonaccitimezones.asp):

    Fibonacci time zones are a technical indicator based on time. The indicator is typically started at a major swing high or swing low on the chart. Vertical lines then extend out to the right, indicating areas of time that could result in another significant swing high, low, or reversal. These vertical lines, which correspond to time on the x-axis of a price chart, are based on Fibonacci numbers.

ƒ??suggests when reversals could occur, based on Fibonacci numbers.

The vertical lines do not have to be on the money, but the chart speaks for itself. I used November 9th 2020 as the starting point, because that was the first sign of increase in volume and price from the previous trends. Also, that was the start of the first remarkable price movement in over six months. This bullish trend continued until February 2nd, 2021 with a price increase from $2.49 to $18.28ƒ?? not badƒ?? maybe it was election results and potential shift for heavy support of green energy? Either way, CLNE peaked the next day on February 3rd at $19.79. I purposefully did not set the end of the first time zone on this date because of the price action; the thicker part of the candle was higher on the 2nd, not the 3rd, which indicates a possible trend reversal. Now, go back and look at the chart and yes, CLNE reversed. The second time zone suggests that CLNE entered a bearish trend that should end around May 10th, and **wouldnƒ??t you know it, CLNE did**.

**And this is where we are now, a possible bull run until around July 20th.**

    Disclaimer: This is a broad time frame. Between May 10th and July 20th, we should see a long-term price movement UP. How far up? Letƒ??s find out. Just understand, that prices donƒ??t just go UP: They can have corrections, trade sideways, consolidate, etc. Expect dips within this window of time.

# Retracement

[Fibonacci Retracement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp):

    Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. They are based on Fibonacci numbers. Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used.

Pretty much, it assists in ~~predicting~~ **theorizing** where support and resistance levels could be based on the Fibonacci numbers.

These levels are:

&amp;#x200B;

|\+100%|$18.785|
|:-|:-|
|\+78.6%|$15.298|
|\+61.8%|$12.561|
|\+50%|$10.639|
|\+38.2%|$8.716|
|\+23.6%|$6.338|
|0%|$2.493|

These prices should be the major support/resistance levels moving forward from **November 9th, 2020**. Now, go back and look at the chart, is it accurate? **Pretty much, every major price movement has tested these levels then bounced or broke through these prices.**

# Blue Line

The blue line is where the stock took a decent in 2014 and has never come close to returning until now.

    I donƒ??t want to flood this post with too much depth on the history of the stock. I just want to point out where the stock has been and analyze where it is going. This post is about next weekƒ??s price action.

# Week of June 14th - 18th

[Two-Hour Time Scale of recent price movement](https://preview.redd.it/ocb943dcnr471.jpg?width=2731&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8144c525baeeea92980b71b66d071e25989a47e9)

First the upward trend. We see a strong rise in support and volume since June 2nd. Apes take notice and near June 8th and the price breaks three levels of resistance. Shorts get excited and unload. The price falls down to theƒ?? **50% Fibonacci Retracement** and holds support. Iƒ??m excited to see if the long-term trend from the 2nd will push the price up to retest $12.56. I suspect that if price retests that level, we will excel beyond to a **minimum of $20.** If the price fails the retest of the 50%, we bounced off it twice June 10th at 11:00 and 14:00, expect a dip to $9.79. On June 11th, we spent the entire day on this level. Which brings the next point.

Price has been consolidating for two days at the 50% retracement, since the price launched to $16.32 and returned after shorting. **I strongly feel that the price will not fall through the 50% retracement.** Should it though, there is a nice long-term support at the $9.79 price. Referring back to the Fibonacci chart, you will see that the price has only fell through that price once, on May 7th in the previous/**bearish** time zone. Furthermore, look at the RSI. The RSI indicates that the price has been hovering at the oversold territory since the descent on Thursday. MACD is indicating a crossover is soon. The 15-day SMA and 200-day EMA show the price is rising above the retracements and continuing a bullish trend.

Letƒ??s make a list:

* Long-term trend ƒ?? BULLISH
* At strong support and 50% retracement ƒ?? BULLISH
* Price consolidation for two days ƒ?? Massive move soon.
* RSI ƒ?? Near oversold
* MACD ƒ?? BULLISH
* 15-SMA/200-EMA ƒ?? BULLISH
* Shorts ƒ?? Unloaded 8.2million shares since the 8th. 800,000 available

# Options

Everyone was excited for the 6/18 13c because of the open interest being 30k+. Letƒ??s look at Fridayƒ??s close.

&amp;#x200B;

[Holy moly! ????????????](https://preview.redd.it/23ofujakur471.jpg?width=2715&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fae2712acc2621e839dcd05167955c369385c3e)

Look at these options. Just wow. Okay, so I fully expect the shorts to use the remaining 800,000 shares. Because even if a fraction of the shares on loan are returned, these options will instantly be in the money. Here is where the star-spangled explosion is, and finally the ??? will go over the ???. If there is an increase in buy pressure, you see where the ramp goes.

Let me add to the previous list:

* Given that the price seems it will not fall through the 50% retracement, it should go up.
* Once the price starts to go up, these options will accelerate the price past the 100% level at $18.785. 
* The price will then be in the territory it has not seen in seven years!

&amp;#8203;

    As always, do your own TA and DD. I would love for someone to poke holes into this TA. 

No price targets. The price appears to want to go to the $15.298/78.6% retracement this week. If it falls through expect a bounce off $9.79 and consolidate at 50% retracement until shorts cover; then definitely 78.6% retracement.

# TL;DR

# So, why didnƒ??t the ??? go MOO-n this week?

* Shorts dumped about \~8.2million shares on the run-up, stopping the previous momentum.
* Shorts donƒ??t want the price above $13 **(see options chain).**
* The price needed to retest the 50% retracement to confirm support, given the massive run this week. CLNE broke three levels of Fibonacci Retracement without retesting any of the lines.

# So what about next week?

* Extremely bullish.
* ????????????????????
* Gamma or no gamma, CLNE ~~is going to~~ **looks to** hit +$20 before July 20th.

# What about that fibonacci stuff?

* Bullish time zone until July 20th.
* Currently at 50% retracement.
* Suspect movement to 78.6% retracement sooner rather than later.

**Over the past two weeks, WSB tends to sticky more bullish posts than bearish posts. Both in general, and for BBBY.**

---

As a mod, I'm constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. 

As of late, the main complaint seems to be that I ""only"" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. 

So let's take a look at everything that's been stickied since August 5th, and see if that's true!

#FAQ:

Q: Why since August 5th? 

A: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. 

Q: (I don't know, I'll add some more questions from the comments when they come)

---

#Methodology:

I took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.

I don't think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I've included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.

#Results!

Overall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.

#Conclusion

This was fun to put together and only took about an hour. 

I was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. 

I'm curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.

There are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. 

This is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)

Another limitation is timing. I think it's fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.

# Meet the Cast

Lion ??? starring as a Market Maker,

Pigs ??? starring as Hedge Funds,

Bananas ??? starring as GME shares, and

Monkeys ??? starring as *YOU*, the casual retail investors!

# What is a Short?

Before understanding what a Short Squeeze is, you need to understand what shorting a stock means.

There is a Lion ??? that owns all of the bananas ??? in the jungle. He sells some of these bananas ??? to Monkeys ???.  There is a Pig ??? named Melvin that thinks the bananas ??? are overpriced right now and expects the price to drop next week. So Melvin the Pig ??? asks Lion ??? if he can borrow some bananas ??? and agrees to return them later. Melvin the Pig ??? then sells the bananas ??? he just borrowed and plans to buy back those bananas ??? next week for cheap after the price has dropped. He can then return the bananas ??? to Lion ??? and keep the profit he just made from selling the bananas ??? for more than he bought them back for. Melvin the Pig ??? just *shorted* the bananas ???.

# So what is happening now?

Melvin the Pig ??? borrowed A LOT of bananas ??? and sold them all thinking he could buy them back for pennies later. But the price went up, *way up*! Melvin the Pig ??? is in some ???? because he still needs to buy back all those bananas ??? he borrowed and sold so he can return them to the Lion ???. The problem for Melvin ??? is that a bunch of Monkeys ??? have decided to buy all the bananas ??? they can and they refuse to sell them back. The bigger problem for Melvin ??? is when he does start buying back the bananas ??? from the Monkeys ???, his large amount of demand with the small amount of supply will drive the price up *even more*! ???? ???? ???? And it'll go up *quick* too. This sudden surge in demand and price is the *short squeeze*.

# So when will the short squeeze happen?

Nobody knows exactly when. There's no expiration date that Lion ??? and Pig ??? agreed to when Pig ??? borrowed the bananas ??? from Lion ???. ""So Pig ??? could just wait forever??"" No you big dummy, you'll get your tendies soon. There are 2 situations that could set off the short squeeze. First, Melvin the Pig ??? agreed to pay Lion ??? a Fee every day he doesn't return the bananas ???. This daily fee is keeping constant pressure on Pig ??? to go ahead and buy back all the bananas ??? he owes Lion ???. Second, Lion ??? can demand Pig ??? returns the bananas ???, and if Lion ??? does this, then Pig ??? would only have a couple of days to comply. This could happen Monday, this could happen in a week, this could happen in a month. Nobody knows exactly when.

# So what do I need to do?

HOLD onto your bananas ???, you Monkey ???! That is literally all you have to do. Hold on with your ????????! My cousin doesn't even have hands and even she can hold onto a banana ??? with her nubs. Right now the Pig ??? is trying to wait us out, paying his daily Fee to the Lion ???, hoping you Monkeys ??? get tired of holding your bananas ??? so he can buy them back for cheaper and return them to Lion ???. Pig ??? doesn't just want our bananas ???, he NEEDS our bananas ???. If we just keep HOLDING our bananas ???, the short squeeze is inevitable. Understand this, this is important! HOLDING decreases supply, which increases price. The higher the price gets, the bigger the daily fee Pig ??? has to pay gets, and the more likely Lion ??? is to demand Pig ??? return all his borrowed shares. HOLDING not only increases the price of your banana ???, but the more Monkeys ??? that hold, the sooner the short squeeze will get here!

# What if the price starts dropping, should I be nervous the short squeeze won't happen? I'm scared!

The short squeeze is inevitable if all you Monkeys ??? just keep holding. In the meantime, the Pigs ??? are going to use every strategy they can to try to scare you into selling your bananas ???. You may have heard the term ""Ladder Attack"" lately. In that case, while you ???, Melvin ???, and his buddy Steve the Rat ??? are standing around the Walnut Tree, Steve ??? will say, very loudly to make sure you can hear it, ""Hey Melvin ???, do you want to buy this banana ??? for $150? I don't want it."" Melvin ??? will buy it for $150, and then a few minutes later say, very loudly to make sure you can hear it, ""Hey Steve ???, do you want to buy this banana ??? for $100? I don't want it."" Steve ??? will buy it for $100. They are trying to trick you ??? into thinking your banana is only worth $100 now, but it's not!!!! Do not panic sell your banana ???! That is what they are trying to get you to do. Remember, the short squeeze is inevitable if we just what? HOLD! The Pigs ??? may also pay their buddy Cramer the Snake ?? to go on television and say ""The Pigs ??? have returned all their bananas ??? to the Lion ???!"" Do not believe the Snake ??. Stay calm.

Man blackberry, who the hell thought Iƒ??d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything youƒ??re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Letƒ??s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe, news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100
Aug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600
May 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100
Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

Iƒ??m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: ƒ??BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.ƒ?

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission

Wanna watch a video? [bideo here](https://youtu.be/fwDnUNENSoY) 

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesnƒ??t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citiƒ??s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum
Tuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET 
with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needhamƒ??s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect &amp; Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesnƒ??t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales arenƒ??t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

Enjoy, go make money","$BB King, the blast from the past with the legendary comeback",44202.86111,t3_ks4s3s,"$BB King, the blast from the past with the legendary comeback **BB is king.**

before anything, this is not financial advice, go fuck yourself you autists. I am a degenerate with a hypothesis. Now that that disclaimer is done

Man blackberry, who the hell thought Iƒ??d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything youƒ??re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Letƒ??s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe, news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100
Aug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600
May 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100
Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

Iƒ??m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: ƒ??BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.ƒ?

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Yet, NOK has been dropping like a fly below price levels from Nov 2020, even though it had an outstanding earnings report??? To top it off, it outperformed it's market competitors, yet the price continues to jump off cliffs?

Obviously it's the hedge funds being dicks. It has to be. The company is doing better than most startups because it actually has cash flow. It had 2.5B Euros in net cash flow, which is up .8B from last Q4.^(1) Cash on hand has increased by 2.1B Euro from last year as well. This is by all means a relatively ""safe"" company to invest in, as it is stockpiling cash and generating it as well...

As an ape, I have been reading the articles on RH because I want to know what they're saying about GME, NOK, BB, and others. Turns out they started posting positive articles on NOK. Yet, NOK has been dropping like a fly below price levels from Nov 2020, even though it had an outstanding earnings report??? To top it off, it outperformed it's market competitors, yet the price continues to jump off cliffs?

Obviously it's the hedge funds being dicks. It has to be. The company is doing better than most startups because it actually has cash flow. It had 2.5B Euros in net cash flow, which is up .8B from last Q4.^(1) Cash on hand has increased by 2.1B Euro from last year as well. This is by all means a relatively ""safe"" company to invest in, as it is stockpiling cash and generating it as well...

PLTR will have many ups and downs. The key to diamond hands is conviction. This worked for Tesla and will work for any other stock.

The best way to form an opinion is to have two imaginary people take the extrem limits of an argument and let them discuss, because the truth is somewhere in the middle.

In order to do that I want you to form the absolute bear case for Palantir.

Once an opinion gets ripped apart and still stands it become conviction, which makes it easy to diamond hand shares.

Why should you not invest in Palantir?

Why is it a bad company with no bright future?

What are your strongest arguments against PLTR?

**ƒ??The world has changed in the past month,ƒ? wrote Jonas in a Tuesday research report. ƒ??However, the story and the balance sheet remain intact.ƒ? Even with the market turmoil, he saw 90% upside in shares, catalyzing his ratings action.**

**Some of that upside has already been eaten up. Virgin Galactic shares (ticker: SPCE) are up 22.2% Tuesday to $15.85. ($19.52 as I'm writing this)** The [S&amp;P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/SPX) Is up 6.8%.

Itƒ??s been an incredible ride for Galactic stock. At one point in February, shares were up more than 220% for the year. They fell 72% from their high to a low of $10.49. The stock was almost $13 before Jonas upgraded it. He referred to the stock as the ƒ??great space coasterƒ? in his report. Given the volatility, that seems apt.

Through it all, shares were up about 12% year to date before Tuesdayƒ??s upgrade-fueled jump. Thatƒ??s far better than comparable drops in the S&amp;P 500 and the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/DJIA).

**One reason Galactic has held up better isƒ??ironicallyƒ??because it doesnƒ??t have sales yet.** The company expects to start flying tourists to the edge of space in 2020. The lack of sales appears to be insulating the company from some of the worst of the Covid-19 fallout.

Were on to something here boys. Notice how the [MASSIVE DROP](https://imgur.com/a/oSlgKXv) in GME shorts correlates exactly with the peak short of XRT-- which was shorted over 800% of float that day. Hedge funds bought to cover their GME shorts while simultaneous shorting XRT, which is an ETF that contains GME. They bought long positions in all stocks contained in the ETF to stay NET SHORT GME. 

**THEY DID NOT COVER.**

This is the fucking DD. Share for visibility. Keep holding.

*Disclaimer: Iƒ??m long GME, obviously*

EDIT: The point of this is NOT to buy XRT. The point of this is that theyƒ??re shorting XRT as a middle man to hide their GME shorts. GME is still very much the play. Read the linked threads for more clarification

My first post was removed for being too short so here are some lyrics from a song I like:   


 

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage  
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?  
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain  
I'm tryin' to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste  
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch  
Deep in a self imposed Stockholm and Lima influx  
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks  
Made any mingling akin to bein' seasoned and stuffed  
It's a theatre of jumpin' jellyfish, jealous little sycophants  
Miserable and flimsy from the skivvys to the pissy pants  
Each one seperately convinced  
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands  
Delusion turn a communication of prison camp  
You fuckin' dorks ain't a threat to the cause  
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost  
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts  
Step out the tempest to measure  
Of what the spectrum involves  
Maybe no one cares, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene  
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe  
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive  
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe  
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong  
The songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog  
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws  
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs  
And a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry  
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling  
God almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys  
Play your own dirge on the way to surfin' maggot beach  
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art  
You can't be cooler than the corners  
Where you source all your parts  
The poker face, all it takes a couple sordid remarks  
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark  
Life is so unfair, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I view the rattling of sabres like a show to expose  
Insecurities exploding in emotional code  
With braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross  
Corrode a homie til his probity is notably ghost  
Before the hobby was a job he was a manager, Hell  
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle  
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill  
That you was anything menacing is a difficult sell  
In a whistle-and-bellorama, black mollies to dress up like piranha  
It's not even compelling melodrama  
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga  
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata  
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need  
This ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed  
I'm off in coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen  
Don't make 'em show the regency what disobedient means  
Heavy load to bear, party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

15196,Hold,,,ExistenceIsntAllThat,s4k5ki,0,262,"Title says it all. I'll keep this at a Barney-level of elementary so you guys can understand the content.

I'm tired of seeing the ""stock went up but I still lost money. HELP!?!?!"" posts.

Complicated concepts are just made up of smaller concepts.

Let's begin.

**Fundamentals I: The Basics)**

An option is the right but not the obligation (hence: option) to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock (the *underlying* asset) at a specified price (*strike price*) and expiration date.

**A call is the right to buy 100 shares; a put is the right to sell 100 shares**

**Intrinsic value:** Value of an option at expiration

**Extrinsic value:** Value of an option at current price minus value of option at expiration (additional value derived from time and volatility rather than inherent, intrinsic value)

If you buy a $300c on $MSFT, and the stock gains $10, you gain $1000 of intrinsic value ($10 x 100) as long as the option is **in the money (ITM)**. ITM means that the option is above the strike price. The advantage is that an ITM option retains its value better, but is more expensive and offers less leverage per dollar, though has the same actual 100x leverage.

If the stock is BELOW the strike price, it is considered **out of the money (OTM)**. This means that the option is inherently worthless. The point of an OTM option is that it is cheaper, offers the same leverage, and has proportionately more leverage per dollar. The disadvantage is that it decays and loses value quickly if the stock goes down. Think *Feast or Famine.* **This is the spirit of WSB.**

**At The Money (ATM)** means that the option is at or very near to the strike price of an option. If you couldn't extrapolate that the advantages/disadvantages of this option are between ITM and OTM, please stop reading and disable options access in your Robinhood account.

**Fundamentals II: The Greeks)**

There are variables that describe the change in value of an option over time, volatility, and price. These are called ""The Greeks"". You don't have to memorize the exact definition, but you should know what each of them mean.

In actuality, there are at least 16 Greeks. First-order, second-order, and third-order to describe rate of change of rate of change of (nonsense). You don't have to know that many.

Here are the main ones:

**Delta: Change in option price per $1 change in the underlying stock**

**Gamma: Change in option Delta per $1 change in the underlying stock**

**Theta: Decay of an option price per day of passed time**

**Vega: Change of an option's price per 1% change of implied volatility**

**Rho: You don't need to know what this is. Option price change vs Interest rates. Barely matters. I'm including it because you autists use Robinhood and it's on there.**

*Q: ""Why are these important?""*

*A: Because you can still lose money when a stock goes the ""right"" direction of your Delta, but Theta and Vega gut your option beyond profit. For example, earnings calls - Volatility drops intensely after the earnings call, and since both puts and calls have positive Vega, you will lose a LOT of value due to Vega.*

Takeaway: Directionality is NOT enough to make profit off of an option. An ATM call or put has, on average, a 33% chance of profit.

**Fundamentals III: The Elusive Intelligent Play)**

Understanding option mechanics is NOT enough to make intelligent moves. Shorting volatility on earnings is statistically positive, yet barely better than guessing even though it's the ""right"" move. 

Take, for example, an ATM TSLA call. Do you know what the profit trajectory looks like? It looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

If people knew that this is what they were agreeing to when they bought an option, much fewer people would participate. OTM options are even worse:

&amp;#x200B;

ITM options are weaker, but still unimpressive.

**Fundamentals IV: Turning a Profit)**

So what is an option good for? Luckily, if you are illegally using insider information, then options are a great choice to multiply you information advantage! If that doesn't apply to you, then you can use them as lottery tickets to scalp sharp price swings for the greatest amount of leverage possible.

If you expect slow but certain price movements, then you may prefer LEAPs, Margin, or Spreads. 

Beware leveraged ETFs: The max drawdown can offset profits. For example, a 10% drawdown turns into a 30% drawdown with 3x leverage. Your position goes from 100% to 70%. Upon regaining 10%, you regain 30%. Your position is now at 91% of its original value. Unless you have an infinite bank roll, losses are more severe than gains of equal magnitude.

A 50% gain can be lost if you give back 33%

A 50% loss can be recovered if you gain 100%

**This is why overallocation in a zero-sum game will ultimately lead to $0, and it's easy to overallocate with leverage. This applies to every form of leverage and volatility. Granted, that's the spirit of wsb. This is why a casino will win with only a 51% advantage and also why they have max bets. You are facing off against insiders, analyst firms, and HFTs, all while you don't have an infinite bankroll, so your advantage is sub-50%.**

*Q: ""How do I turn a profit?""*

A: Get lucky, obtain an information advantage, or invest long-term to reap inflation &amp; appreciation

*Q: ""How do I get an information advantage?""*

A: With hyper-autistic levels of DD, or befriend a senator/other insider.

*Q: ""Okay thanks, that's everything""*

A: I'm glad you asked. An option spread is a combination of two or more options together to form a play. The advantages are that you can negate Theta, Vega, and even short volatility without having to sell naked (which is not an option on the Robinhood platform). You may recognize the term ""Box spread"" from a particular retard who made Robinhood change their terms and conditions.

Here is an ATM call debit spread on TSLA ($1045c 1/21 buy, $1050c 1/21 sell for $258 entry $500 max profit):

A 48% chance to almost double your money is much more in line with what most of you are looking for. Double $8k four times and you will have around $128k.

Advantages: Neutral theta (positive or negative depending on whether it's ITM or OTM), little to no Vega, very efficient leverage, cheap option spread (the pictured above only costs $258 to enter). You retain a lot of value near expiration if the stock is not going your way. Look at -2% from 2 days out on the above chart. You lose roughly half of your spread's value despite being OTM and very close to expiry. However, as I will mention again soon: The lower liquidity will likely make this a worse deal upon entry and exit.

Disadvantage: Much less opportunity to scalp. Option is meant to expire to receive full value, so you're usually riding the option until it's dead. On rare occasions, the ITM option you sold may be exercised, but your broker is supposed to take care of this for you. There is less liquidity, so you will have a harder time entering and exiting trades at fair prices since you're eating liquidity two times upon entry, and two times upon exit (if you choose to exit at any point).

**Conclusion:**

YOLO $TSLA 1150c 1/21",Options Mechanics And Principles For Beginners,44576.2625,t3_s4k5ki,"Options Mechanics And Principles For Beginners Title says it all. I'll keep this at a Barney-level of elementary so you guys can understand the content.

I'm tired of seeing the ""stock went up but I still lost money. HELP!?!?!"" posts.

Complicated concepts are just made up of smaller concepts.

Let's begin.

**Fundamentals I: The Basics)**

An option is the right but not the obligation (hence: option) to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock (the *underlying* asset) at a specified price (*strike price*) and expiration date.

**A call is the right to buy 100 shares; a put is the right to sell 100 shares**

**Intrinsic value:** Value of an option at expiration

**Extrinsic value:** Value of an option at current price minus value of option at expiration (additional value derived from time and volatility rather than inherent, intrinsic value)

If you buy a $300c on $MSFT, and the stock gains $10, you gain $1000 of intrinsic value ($10 x 100) as long as the option is **in the money (ITM)**. ITM means that the option is above the strike price. The advantage is that an ITM option retains its value better, but is more expensive and offers less leverage per dollar, though has the same actual 100x leverage.

If the stock is BELOW the strike price, it is considered **out of the money (OTM)**. This means that the option is inherently worthless. The point of an OTM option is that it is cheaper, offers the same leverage, and has proportionately more leverage per dollar. The disadvantage is that it decays and loses value quickly if the stock goes down. Think *Feast or Famine.* **This is the spirit of WSB.**

**At The Money (ATM)** means that the option is at or very near to the strike price of an option. If you couldn't extrapolate that the advantages/disadvantages of this option are between ITM and OTM, please stop reading and disable options access in your Robinhood account.

First, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first.

I see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.

If we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset.

I see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided.

First, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option.

Even they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) .

Then let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\*100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.

I didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.

So, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.

Please correct me if I have any mistakes.

Position, 104@110

EDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   ????????????????????????????????

EDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.

Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\*45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%.

I didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses.

So, call options can't be a good way for them to cover.

Please correct me if I have any mistakes.

Position, 104@110

EDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them.   ????????????????????????????????

EDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also.

**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?

**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). 

After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.

In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.

What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. 

So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.

I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). 

For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.

The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.

Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people and to use the media to do it (including paid news articles).

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/). Also definitely worth an extensive read is [this amazing DD, on its own website](https://www.gmedd.com/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in. **News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday, they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting.**

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)
4. Unavailability of consoles (as if this has anything to do with Gamestop)

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease above likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason ""in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital"". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

Source: [SEC Filings](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 3: Some form of WSB bashing

1) They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB. This is not entirely false: this subreddit, the repeated DDs on it, and people's ""rabid"" attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory. This is the age of the individual investor though, and the way media works has changed. There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and/or betting on its success. This is exactly what the MM's do, the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money, and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money.

2) Y'all have been rude AF. Not saying anything against it, I'm just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we've seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days. They will call you rabid, they will call you crazy idiots, they will call you insane gamblers, they will imply (but never say on air) that you are ""autists"" and ""retards""...and in ~~some~~ most cases, they'll even be right. However, I hope that anyone reading this who isn't a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock, while inspired by such fanaticism, is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone (See #1, see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day).

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

1) Now here, I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), and [still higher than float at EOD Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18jvw/gme_short_interest_update_703m_shares_short/), meaning there is an absolutely obscene # of shorted shares (a ""high"" number is often cited as 20-30%, we're at 100%). We'll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

**Important Update here based on re-analysis.**

**The # of shorted shares from Wed-Fri was approximately 71.4M (approximately the current # of shares short). Citron's analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts, and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points (less pressure). I think they are partially correct. However:**

**1) Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward.** This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open, but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day. We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days, so at least some of the shorts were due to this. In fact, I expect that a very large number of those 71.4M shorted shares were temporary shorts, based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months (millions per day) and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period (almost none, relatively).

**2) Shorts have been re-opened.** The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short, or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts (could be as high as $20, but that's only for some of the shorts). However, **the fact that a similar level of % short/float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present** even if these are new shorts, but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price.

**3) With GME's current trajectory (even if we discount Wednesday's meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months), even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger.** If they weren't, we wouldn't be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation (see Tuesday's 2x1M share sell-offs).

BONUS) It's important to note that the borrowing fees, while not insignificant, are reasonably trivial for a large institution. It amounts to something like $0.03 per day per share, even at 30% on a $40 stock. They can hold for a month and if they make $1 per share, they're still up. However, this adds up. Also, eventually, the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale. Finally, if trajectory continues to go up, it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain, driving up price.

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 5: More shares traded on some days than are short. Meaning days to cover is not close to accurate.

This is absolutely true. Days to cover is based on an average of the daily volume over the past few days. What they will say is that because daily volume is higher then shorts can cover very easily. Here's three reasons I disagree:

1. the volume shorted over the past week has consistently been around 20%+ of the daily volume. Therefore we can discount 20% of the volume as that has no net effect on the number of shorts.
2. any increase in volatility of a stock will lead to increased trading. That means more sellers, but also more buyers. **The days to cover metric is based ONLY on volume. That means that it assumes that every share bought is bought to replace a shorted share. That is unlikely to ever be the case, especially in today's market which is saturated by retail investors because of trading apps. They're using 1900s math in 2021.**
3. Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday, while % short hasn't changed, so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday (even though days to cover isn't the greatest measure). So this is less and less in the shorters' favor as volume decreases, and we have a similar % short/float.

# So what will happen?

**THIS IS A GUESS. But, based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at IKBR at approximately the same time as the Citron announcement on Tuesday, I suspect tomfoolery. In addition, Citron just started doing these ""twitter Live"" things two days ago. Yes, GME wasn't the first one, but it's still a very recent new thing. At the same time, GME has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media, not to mention the likely** [months of naked shorting](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9mu0/gme_comrades_115_update_27_consecutive_days_on/). **Citron also conveniently decided to delay their twitter live for the inauguration, as they were hoping for a higher viewership (or potential viewership), which makes perfect sense, but still seems strange that on the SECOND LIVE TWITTER THEY DID (for the good of their viewers), THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE ELECTION.**

None of this happened yesterday because yesterday was a slightly lower volume day than usual, and their strategies to drive down price require maximum exposure. If they're very aggressive and trigger SEC Rule 201 again, they're limited in their shorting options on the next day.

Option 1: we have a repeat of Friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down GME price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory. They can do this because SEC Rule 201 is not active (so they can short on a downtick again).

Option 2: Shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did Tuesday. Then at around 11:30 (+/- 1 hour), GME will start to tank rapidly (potentially due again to some big 1M share sells). If it was me, I would time it and hit it very hard so it hits -10% for the day (the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks) as close to the Citron announcement as possible, with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paper-handers to sell. Remember, due to puts expiring Friday, there is likely significant pressure on shorters to drive price below $35 or as close as they can asap.

Option 3: Small but steady downward pressure, in the hopes of making retail investors get bored and leave so that the stock price goes down.

Gamestop will also announce an influx of new consoles sometimes tomorrow. This helps push stock up, and I bet they time it to be right before Citron's twitter live if they can, and my personal hope is that there's something unexpected about this influx of new consoles (perhaps a larger number than usual due to a new deal?), but I don't expect this to have a super huge effect.",Update: On Citron's 5 reasons and how they might try to manipulate you tomorrow,44216.91438,t3_l1rf94,"Update: On Citron's 5 reasons and how they might try to manipulate you tomorrow Obligatory disclaimer: I am not an expert, nor have I been doing this long.

Before I get into this, I need to say two things first. One, shorters will keep shorting, they're in too deep. Second, they will also do their absolute best to make ANYONE ELSE sell or short too, and they've had years of practice on how to manipulate people and to use the media to do it (including paid news articles).

# Reason 1: GME is a mall-store blockbuster (no future), will cite earnings reports

Please see this [very extensive Due Diligence (DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) along with this [fascinating new development](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/). Also definitely worth an extensive read is [this amazing DD, on its own website](https://www.gmedd.com/).

GME is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things, even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited. Long buyers are in. **News people are starting to pivot more and more as of Wednesday, they cannot deny the trajectory in the face of continued shorting.**

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely things they will cite are:

1. Total sales declined 3.1% in the holiday sales report
2. Large 3rd quarter sales declines (pre-covid vs post-covid the most likely cause).
3. Closed 11% of stores (which they did to cut underperforming stores, and because their stores are FAR too dense, especially given an increased focus on E-commerce)
4. Unavailability of consoles (as if this has anything to do with Gamestop)

&amp;#x200B;

Most likely things they will intentionally leave out:

1. Comparable store sales increased 4.8% in holiday report (so, decrease above likely because of store closures)
2. E-commerce is at 34% of company sales, equivalent to Best Buy percentage (and growing rapidly, and more rapidly than Best Buy)
3. Regional sales in Australia/New Zealand (no covid) went UP 31%

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 2: Insiders are selling

This is true. But here are the facts that they will leave out:

1/12/21-1/13/21: Hestia Capital (whose managing member is Wolf Kurt James) sold 945,550 shares of GME for this reason ""in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of Hestia Capital"". The fund still owns 91,000 shares and Wolf Kurt James PERSONALLY AND DIRECTLY still owns 50,689 (including 20,000 of his wife's shares).

Also,

1/13/21: Dunn Lizabeth sold 5,000 shares of GME. She still owns 57,258.

1/13/21-1/15/21: Raul J Fernandez sold 31,119 shares of GME. He still owns 29,289 *\[updated\]*

1-13-21: Kathy P Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares of GME. She still owns 79,537.

The forms regarding the previous 3 people's sales were all filed by Dunn Lizabeth, suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice. Also, all three of those people are NOT on the Board of Directors as proposed by RC Ventures (and conditionally agreed to by Gamestop, an agreement they'll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon RC Ventures' buy-in and policy changes that RC Ventures has strongly suggested/recommended)

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 3: Some form of WSB bashing

1) They will likely ascribe most if not all of the upward trajectory of Gamestop to WSB. This is not entirely false: this subreddit, the repeated DDs on it, and people's ""rabid"" attention has indeed contributed to the upward trajectory. This is the age of the individual investor though, and the way media works has changed. There is nothing shady or inappropriate about large groups of people believing in something and then pursuing and/or betting on its success. This is exactly what the MM's do, the difference is that they have few people moving lots of money, and WSB has lots of people each moving a little money.

2) Y'all have been rude AF. Not saying anything against it, I'm just saying that there will be backlash to the kind of savagery we've seen against Citron and Melvin in the past few days. They will call you rabid, they will call you crazy idiots, they will call you insane gamblers, they will imply (but never say on air) that you are ""autists"" and ""retards""...and in ~~some~~ most cases, they'll even be right. However, I hope that anyone reading this who isn't a WSB fanatic will recognize that the movement of this stock, while inspired by such fanaticism, is not based on some rabid fanaticism alone (See #1, see the hundreds of tickers posted here every day).

&amp;#x200B;

# Reason 4: The short squeeze has already happened

1) Now here, I expect them to throw up some fancy crayon data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest % of daily trading or fees to short and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered. Here's the important data (there's some in the DD in #1 as well).

First, [Short interest was higher than float as of EOD Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzwo2z/gme_short_interest_declined_to_71m_and_some_other/), and [still higher than float at EOD Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l18jvw/gme_short_interest_update_703m_shares_short/), meaning there is an absolutely obscene # of shorted shares (a ""high"" number is often cited as 20-30%, we're at 100%). We'll see updated numbers for EOD Wednesday in the early morning. Short interest actually INCREASED during the Wed-Thurs time that Citron was originally saying was the short squeeze. Now, these are Ortex estimates based on the self-reported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages, but have been very reliable  when compared to the official SEC data that comes out every half a month.

**Important Update here based on re-analysis.**

**The # of shorted shares from Wed-Fri was approximately 71.4M (approximately the current # of shares short). Citron's analysis will say that shorters have COVERED their original shorts, and what we are seeing now are NEW shorts at higher price points (less pressure). I think they are partially correct. However:**

**1) Shorters will have wanted to drive down price on Wed onward.** This means that the shorted shares are not necessarily new opened shorts that are still open, but may have been temporary shorts that were covered on the same day. We have seen a lot of temporary shorting in the past few days, so at least some of the shorts were due to this. In fact, I expect that a very large number of those 71.4M shorted shares were temporary shorts, based on the number of shares sold short each day over the past few months (millions per day) and the overall changes in the total number of shorted shares over the same period (almost none, relatively).

**2) Shorts have been re-opened.** The difference between their loss on a new short after covering an old short, or from holding the original short is the difference in price between those two shorts (could be as high as $20, but that's only for some of the shorts). However, **the fact that a similar level of % short/float exists today means that the EXACT SAME potential for a short squeeze is present** even if these are new shorts, but the pressure is somewhat lower as the current price MIGHT be closer to the short price.

**3) With GME's current trajectory (even if we discount Wednesday's meteoric rise and just look at the last 6 months), even those hypothetical higher price point shorts are still in significant danger.** If they weren't, we wouldn't be seeing this huge pushback from media and such aggressive market manipulation (see Tuesday's 2x1M share sell-offs).

BONUS) It's important to note that the borrowing fees, while not insignificant, are reasonably trivial for a large institution. It amounts to something like $0.03 per day per share, even at 30% on a $40 stock. They can hold for a month and if they make $1 per share, they're still up. However, this adds up. Also, eventually, the broker will need to fill real share buy orders and can force an immediate sale. Finally, if trajectory continues to go up, it just stops being worth trying to short it and someone will start a selling chain, driving up price.

3. Trading volume has actually been decreasing since last Wednesday, while % short hasn't changed, so current volumes will mean more time to cover again compared to last Wednesday (even though days to cover isn't the greatest measure). So this is less and less in the shorters' favor as volume decreases, and we have a similar % short/float.

1.**Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International** ???

These guys a popular choice to choose when sponsoring endangered apes directly on here. Funding goes directly to anti-poaching/research/education and local communities (highly important). Their C.E.O has already thanked WSB personally: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a\_message\_to\_wsb\_from\_the\_director\_of\_the\_dian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/)

If they can be a Gorila stronghold for 50 years you can hold till we get to the moon 

**2. Virunga National Park** ???

This is personal: Earlier this year 6 gorilla rangers were shot and killed here on January 12th in an ambush. There are poor countries in Africa, then thereƒ??s the Congo ƒ?? it receives very little help and small donations would be a huge fucking help. You can choose to adopt a fellow ape and the money would go towards helping the entire park protect our brothers and sisters.

**3. African Parks**

https://preview.redd.it/zqypxo3e10n61.png?width=216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21a7615595a7c9c7180f6b7d37ed042880b3f6f1

These guys are kings in what they do and probably the most important on this list. They're taking long term control of natural areas across the continent and provide protection and management to over 40,000 square miles (roughly the size of Germany). Their work involves all aspects of park management, from research projects to anti-poaching. Africa parks will be responsible for preserving green spaces in Africa for years to come.

**4. Frankfort zoological society** ???

In honour of HeyItsPixeL FZS is a German-based NGO with a focus on conserving biodiversity and protecting wilderness areas through multiple projects around the globe ƒ?? a really efficient organisation and industry renown for effective strategies.

**5. Endangered wildlife trust** 

[https://www.ewt.org.za/campaigns/ewt-donations/](https://www.ewt.org.za/campaigns/ewt-donations/)

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys are lucky enough to go and see wild predators in Africa in 20 years itƒ??ll be largely due to the work these guys do. This South Africa NGO uses applied research to maintain predator and bird of prey species populations within and around protected areas. Projects are primarily in South Africa but are expanding to other African countries such as Malawi and Mozambique. Personally working for these guys would be my dream job.

**6. Elephants Without Borders**

[https://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/](https://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pswatv4g10n61.jpg?width=200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a901583dd81c6818bf31b721ee79b429175328f6

Iƒ??ve seen a couple of elephants been sponsored in the name of GameStop and would love to nominate this NGO as a candidate for anyone willing. Primarily these guys operate within Botswana (the country with the highest population of elephants in the world and also known for its ????'s). The African elephant population is bearish, to say the least ƒ?? these guys are doing great things to try and bring it back up.

**7. Naankuse Foundation Wildlife Sanctuary**

[https://naankuse.com/donate/](https://naankuse.com/donate/)

https://preview.redd.it/no64h2rg10n61.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a30bf4679dc1e95e8677e5138340015e778714a

This is the only wildlife sanctuary that I know of that I would put on the list. Naankuse started by saves predators (mainly cheetahs) that have been captured by farmers that would otherwise shoot them for eating their livestock. Now theyƒ??ve grown into a huge ecotourism organisation that I would recommend volunteering with if you want to get up close with African wildlife.

**8. Jane Goodall Institute** ???

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img r5oy2lfh10n61...*

Someone change that leaf to a diamond

Finishing the list with the queen of Primatology herself Jane Goodall. The institute provides sanctuaries in multiple countries for apes that have been affected by poaching or wildlife conflict for rehabilitation and hopefully release. Jane Goodall herself has made a huge impact on ape populations across Africa and probably responsible for countless wild populations of chimpanzees

**Final appreciation**

I wanted to thank you all of you apes ƒ?? Iƒ??ve chosen a field of work that I love but will never make me rich but when GME takes off, Iƒ??ll continue perusing my dream of helping African wildlife but after visiting different galaxies onboard the monkey expresses Iƒ??ll be able to contribute way more than I ever could thanks to you guys. 

But remember the only ticket on the monkey express to the baboon galaxy is diamond hands baby ƒ?? hold not for my dreams but for your own! ????

**Thesis:**  
With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur. *Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity. *    
&amp;nbsp;

--  
**Background:**  
Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $2.5 dollar.

--  
**Results:**   
Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.  

--  
**How did Gamestop survive for so long?**  
Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.

**The turnaround:**  
A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:   
  
1. Optimized the Core Business  
	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works  
2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming  
	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store  
3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem  
	Revamp the supply chain to be e-commerce focused  
4. Transform Vendor Partnership  
	Rekindle and make new partnerships   
  
Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming. 

--  
The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aim?? onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that. 

--  
As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.    

--  
The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that ""for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well."" To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.  
 
--  
Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $4.81 and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.  

--  
""GameStopƒ??s leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences ƒ?? not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""  

--  
It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $14.83. This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $22.35 dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $17.35.    

--  
**Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:**  
Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.    

--  
Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:  
- First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season, 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, 3.1% decrease in total sales.  
	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.  
- Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people. 
	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.  
	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares  
	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority  
Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at 20.5 and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared. This catalyzed into a gamma squeeze to kick off the huge rally.  

--  
The analysis stopped dead of the gamma squeeze as these recent events have been a gray area of interpretation. Enjoy.

First, lets talk about the part of the real estate market that's gonna go bust that everyone knows about (or at least that people who pay attention to this shit or read my previous DDs know about): CMBS.  This is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Market.  These are loans on commercial buildings that have been securitized, bundled, and sold to investors.  The following is an explanation of the CMBS issues I wrote for another DD over six months ago:

*The CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) Bomb*

*This one is a bit different from the mess we had in 2008 with MBS (mortgage backed securities) because it's a different market with different rules, and it's a smaller total market than MBS.*

*That said, the problems here might actually be worse. There is a company called Ladder Capital, formed out of the remnants of the Bear Stearns bond department, that has struck an unusual deal with Dollar Store, and they have a LOT of properties that are very, very much coasting on made up mortgages. I could easily write like three pages on this one partnership alone, but I'll just summarize instead and say these people learned absolutely nothing from 2008 except that it was a profitable scam that carried no jail time.*

*To understand just how bad the CMBS mess is, you need to understand how CMBS' work. At first glance, they're similar to regular MBS, it's a bundle of tens or hundreds of mortgages for commercial properties, they're divided into tranches (usually six) and the lowest tranches pay out the highest yields but also fail first. And now things get a little complex, so I'm going to simplify like crazy here, but this is the most important part to understand why this is all going to blow up.*

*A commercial building is an income generating property, it's market value is derived from how much income it generates. The bank lending you the money will want you to put up some amount of collateral for the loan. If rents go up, the amount of collateral you have to post goes down. If rent goes down, the amount of collateral you have to post goes UP. Now the weird thing about CMBS loans is that if only half your building is rented, you can just pay half your mortgage and whatever you owe for the other half of the building just gets added to the end of the loan. Now, say you can't rent out the empty half of your building, and you want to renegotiate the terms of your loan rather than just keep adding debt to the back of your loan. Well, this is where the CMBS comes into play, because all those different tranches? The investors behind them have different incentives, the guys at the lowest tranches don't want you to modify the loan, because that means losses, and they take those losses first, while the guys in the highest tranche want to modify the loan because it generates more income for them and they're not eating any losses. Unfortunately for you, in most CMBS agreements you need a supermajority of 70-80% of the votes to get a loan modification.*

*So, to lower rents to market rates and get the building rented out, since you can't get a loan modification, you, the landlord, have to write a check to the bank to make up the difference between the value of the building at the old, higher rental rate and the value of the building at the new, lower rate. Or you can just do nothing, get an extra write off for your taxes, and hope some sucker comes in and rents at the higher price or a different sucker comes along and buys the place from you, making it their problem. This is why you'll see so many empty storefronts with ridiculous asking prices that the landlords won't budge on - it's because they can't.*

*I really, really skimmed just the teeniest top of the surface on this subject, but basically all those CMBS notes that are super toxic start coming due in March of 2022, and they're going to absolutely detonate the commercial property market. Many banks and investment groups will be destroyed when these go bad, just like in 2008.*

[Video of Empty Stores in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqSUhVjS77o)

*This is a video from a guy who just walked around downtown NYC showing all the empty stores and how the place basically looks like a dead mall now.*

*TIMEFRAME: March 2022*

Well, I said March 2022 was when these shit CMBS notes were going to start detonating/causing problems.  Let's check shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

[God that's a big shampoo commercial.](https://preview.redd.it/r77f17nd4kw81.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61734dd411a82c7f1ab2c6d68b750336a9454b9d)

You see that little spike at the end of the head and shoulders before it really dives to new all time lows?  Yeah, that's the last day of February, 2022.  

Ok, so that's 1/3 of the US real estate market, what about the 2/3rds of the market that's residential?  Well, this is where it gets weird, and how everyone (including me) kept missing it.  I've written before about the issues with the US housing market - housing units relative to population has actually increased over the last decade+, while homeownership rates have dropped and prices have skyrocketed.  

Everyone who looks at the residential market thinks its being bought by residents, and that all the people buying today are actually qualified buyers with good credit scores and jobs and such.  And that is true for all the people buying houses.  There is not a repeat of the 2008 sub-prime debacle with NINJA (No Income, No Job, no Assets) loans.  What is new - and whenever you get a financial crisis it's always, ALWAYS driven in large part by a ""new"" type of financial instrument (read debt) - is the sheer number of homes being bought up by with cash, and it's inferred these are all institutions and foreigners.  For example, about $90 billion in US real estate was bought by foreigners in 2021.  Wall Street however, blew that away, hitting as high as 1-in-7 of all homes and 1-in-2 of all apartments.

Now, people look at that record institutional/foreigner buying and think it's the explanation, but the truth is, even with those crazy numbers, 6-in-7 homes and 1-in-2 apartments are still being bought by regular people, often with, again, ""cash"".

These purchases are frequently referred to as ""cash buys"" because the buyer just pays the seller cash.  However, they don't actually have piles of cash lying around in freighters to pay for this stuff.  They take out loans. Specifically, they take out loans on their equity assets.  Now this is where it starts getting sticky, because institutions are not buying these houses and apartments as residences, they're buying them as income generating properties.  

In traditional home mortgage loans, there are two things assessed: the value of the house, which acts as collateral for the loan, and the borrower's ability to pay back said loan via wages or assets.  It's a relatively simple two-factor risk analysis.

Now, let's look at what risks the Wall Street owned rental homes are subject to: income generated/rental rates, housing values, stock/derivative values, interest rates, urban planning, crime rates, and overall market returns.  So basically, the money being loaned is getting assessed on a one-factor risk analysis: value of assets under management (AUM) of the borrower.  But then that money is getting used to buy a whole bunch of houses/apartments, and all of a sudden it's subject to a whole horde of other risks, and the original risk profile is more useless than you are with your compensated evening companionship after a couple drinks.

There's one other thing I haven't mentioned yet, that's huge, and the reason Wall Street never really messed around with buying up everyone's house before the 2008 crash.  And it's a big one:  Liquidity.  More specifically:  Liquidity of Assets.  Lemme say that one more time for the folks in the back recovering from barnyard animal sex gone wrong hearing loss:

# Liquidity of Assets

Wut mean?  Glad you asked 'tard.  Liquidity of Assets (LoA) basically means how easy or hard it is to sell an asset.  Now, one of the reasons wall street hedge funds and investment banks can do things like leverage up at 37.5-1 (the theoretical max level they use) or, say, 200-1 (the level Goldman is at according to the last 13F filing I read) is because the money is backed by securities and derivatives and other financial instruments which are extremely liquid.  So if things go tits up like the Titanic, the lender can force a sell off of this stuff very quickly to get their money back.  Now in reality this isn't true, or Credit Suisse and Nomura wouldn't still be dragging around Archegos bags from last year, and Bill Hwang couldn't have pulled a Reddit meme and avoided margin calls by not answering the phone (yes, that really, actually, in real life, happened).  But in theory, it is.

Now, housing?  Housing is illiquid as fuck.  It takes a lot of time and effort to sell a house.  Or to buy one.  There are special rules and whatnot from the federal government about what kind of collateral and stuff you need for a residential house.  2008 was so bad because the banks basically ignored all of those.  After 2008 one of the few things the government sort-of did fix was tightening up lending standards for retail (regular people), so everyone who's looking at the last crash sees that retail borrowers aren't overleveraged with bad loans and sub-prime and thinks it can't happen again.  But all those rules and whatnot get ignored if the buyer is paying ""cash"".  This is the financial equivalent of the military expression ""Generals always fight the last war"".  

**The massive use of margin/equity backed loans by both retail and institutions to buy property has taken two separate markets, the liquid/volatile equity market, and the illiquid/stable housing market, and stitched them together like a human centipede with dogshit wrapped in catshit debt passing back and forth into one market that is unequally liquid and extremely price volatile.**

If you need proof that this is what's happening, lemme help you out with some charts that illustrate my point:

This is US Margin debt over the last few years

https://preview.redd.it/27i0k94w6pw81.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42eb68f00af67a6afad37582123d3277c940409

Now lets compare it to US home prices over the same period

https://preview.redd.it/5d5qtnvbhpw81.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60e5cbd4091a43a3e437532cb9fa414d4a345d9

So basically, we've got loans on inflated assets fueling loans on other inflated assets.  This is feedback loop that goes parabolic.. then crashes, hard.  You can see the margin debt coming down and forming the first valley before it goes back up a little to complete the Head and Shoulders pattern, then drills down into the center of the earth.  Because housing is illiquid, it's going to lag that drop, but as you can see from the price curve leveling off, it's getting ready to do the same thing.

Now, we know that there are a ton of loans using inflated, volatile collateral on illiquid, inflated assets.  And this is a certified bad thing.  But the coming death spiral of equity/asset sales isn't the only giant elephant in the room everyone is ignoring.  I'm talking of course, about Evergrande in specific and Chinese property bonds in general.

The list of Chinese real estate developers that aren't paying their employees, debts, bonds, or suppliers is actually longer than you pretend your wang is, so we'll just use Evergrande as a proxy for the whole lot of them.

Evergrande hasn't made hundreds of millions of dollars of interest payment on bonds since September.  A couple weeks ago they failed to pay the principal payment on a maturing bond to the tune of $2.1 Billion.  So, you'd think that means their debt is junk and they've defaulted, right?

Not so fast.  Let's check what the big 3 ratings agencies have to say about it:

Fitch:  RD - Restricted Default

S&amp;P: SD - Selective Default

Moody's: Caa1- Rated as Poor Quality and Very High Credit Risk

You notice what's missing from all of those?  ""D"" - Default.  Evergrande has missed everything they can possibly miss, and they're still not rated D.  Hell, those brazen cockchuffers at Moody's actually have 4 separate ratings lower than what they're slapping on EG bonds.  Here, let me take a second to speak in the meme language you smooth brained retards actually might understand:

https://preview.redd.it/dc1p7y99fqw81.jpg?width=849&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7adb931a585d603db30e2b6b8456db353404948

The reason that none of these agencies will put the ""D"" on Evergrande bonds is twofold - 

1: they don't want to piss off the Chinese government

2: the banks and hedge funds that are their primary clients are balls deep in this debt and can't get it off their books because shockingly people haven't forgotten how those same banks and hedge funds fucked, saddled, and rode them with garbage debt in 2008.

Why is this relevant to US housing, equities, and the margin loans financing the spiraling prices of both?  Easy.  The same people who hold the worthless Chinese debt also hold trillions of dollars of equities that they've taken margin loans against to buy trillions of dollars of US Housing.  After Amazon's Q4 earngings, everyone who looked into them said ""Holy crap!  The only thing holding up their ER is this $110 Billion Rivian valuation!""  Some people even made memes about it on WSB pointing out that it was the only thing holding up the entire US market.  Now, what happened when AMZN's Q1 ER came out and the RIVN valuation had dropped to more realistic levels?  Right, a -189% miss on earnings and a huge bear run on SPY and QQQ.  

&gt;!Quick shout out to those of you who like to play options on stock lockup expiries - RIVN's lockup ends on May 8th, and AMZN and F have a ton of shares with a cost basis of $10 they can sell on or after that date.  The price is currently $30.  You do the math on if they want to hold onto that garbage once they can dump it at a profit.!&lt;

That's a huge drop in the collateral backing all that margin debt.  Is it enough to cause the Mother of all Margin Calls (MMC) and set off the worst crash since 1929?  Nope.  Not yet.  But it's coming.  Remember how people pointed out on AMZN's last ER how they were actually super fuk?  Yeah, you know who had a supposedly positive ER but is actually super-mega-fuk and just lied through their teeth about it? Apple.  AAPL doesn't have a single factory working right now, and their by far #1 market - China - is in the midst of complete economic collapse.  &gt;!(the politburo doesn't have emergency meetings about giant spending packages because things are going well)!&lt;  They gave zero guidance on either of these things, which makes me think that it's even worse than I think it is, and I think it's fucking horrible.  But back to the bad Chinese debt. The reason Wall Street can survive a hit to something like AMZN and the indexes is that they're hedged to the balls for stuff like that.  Know what they're not hedged for?  Chinese property bonds universally going to zero.

So what happens when the collateral for those margin loans goes down?  I'm sure you retards behind Wendy's have all heard this one before - you get a margin call.  First, you (or more likely your broker) sells equities.  But if equities are all dropping, they comin' for that money, and they're looking at your assets to get it.  Guess what?  Housing and commercial real estate are both assets they can force sales on.  So that same self-reinforcing spiral that drove up both equity and real estate prices?  It's going to go into reverse, but here's the thing, when everyone is selling at the same time, prices go down really, really, really, really, really, really fast.

We learned this last time in 2008.  This time, because the housing market is directly tied to the crashing stocks, instead of indirectly through people who will default over time as they lose their jobs or balloon payments come due or rates adjust, it's going to happen all at once, faster and more violently.  We actually got a brief preview of what this is going to look like thanks to the wild incompetence and greed at Zillow - Z.  Their stock crashed 40% in five days when it was revealed they'd bought too many houses they couldn't rent or flip and had to sell them at a loss.  And that was just a couple of neighborhoods in Arizona.  When this hits nationwide, it's going to be exponentially worse.

How much worse?  Well, that depends on where you are.  Here's some graphs explaining that while the US is fuk, somehow our Maple Swiling neighbors to the north are exponentially worse off - life lesson, don't tie yourself to China kids.

This is bad, but it's kind of hiding how bad because the data cuts off too soon after the COVID crash.

Yeah, Canada.. I'm sorry maple's.  It's gonna be rough.  Good luck, and care with RBC, pretty sure that between a huge position in Chinese debt and an incredible number of soon to be bad mortgages and margin loans they're completely worthless.

Look, I started writing DD's last fall saying we'd just gone into recession but nobody noticed and everyone laughed at me and said I was crazy.  After that Q1 GDP miss it looks a bit different, ya?  Last summer I wrote about how CMBS was fuk and it would start coming due in March 2022, and people pointed and laughed.  See the chart earlier in this post.  Now I'm telling you that the banks and the Fed and every fucking person has fucked up and missed that real estate and equities have gotten tied up in a gordian knot that's getting sucked into a black hole of failure.  I'd like to be wrong.  I've been wrong before (see my terrible takes on corporate hedging of HYG for an example), but I don't think I'm wrong here.  

The market and housing and everything is going down like Anne Robbins trying to get off the Hollywood black list.  I've never given dates before because I didn't have a good enough idea of when things would finally hit a critical mass.  If we keep following the 2008 chart (thanks for being predictable algorithms!) we're going to go up for a couple of weeks then crash sometime between the end of May and the middle/end of July.  Summer collapses are historically rather rare, so I like this fall myself, but I wouldn't be surprised by either outcome.

**TL;DR:** **In 2008, the unknown weapons of financial mass destruction were sub-prime loans, MBS, CDS, and CDOs.  In 2022 they're margin loans, asset backed loans, Chinese bonds, and ""cash"" purchased assets.**

This is how inflation leaked into the real economy from the assets it was supposed to be segregated in.  Fed printer goes brrrrr --&gt; assets inflate --&gt; margin loans against assets drive up real estate --&gt; owners of real estate suddenly have lots of extra money --&gt; inflation.

As of November of '21, the Fed had printed $13 Trillion since the start of COVID.  $1 Trillion was stimmies.  The rest?  The rest went to the rich via inflated asset prices and debt purchases.  Don't believe them when they try to blame this shitshow on stimmies and the just now conveniently-mentioned-in-the-media ""return of sub-prime loans"" bit.  They just want a chance to blame this on poor people and immigrants to avoid having anyone look at them.  And don't think JPow's greedy ass can save you this time, to match the financial impact of what the Fed did during COVID they'd have to print nearly $60 Trillion.  That's Weimar Republic territory, if we're not headed there already.

First, lets talk about the part of the real estate market that's gonna go bust that everyone knows about (or at least that people who pay attention to this shit or read my previous DDs know about): CMBS.  This is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Market.  These are loans on commercial buildings that have been securitized, bundled, and sold to investors.  The following is an explanation of the CMBS issues I wrote for another DD over six months ago:

*The CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) Bomb*

*This one is a bit different from the mess we had in 2008 with MBS (mortgage backed securities) because it's a different market with different rules, and it's a smaller total market than MBS.*

*That said, the problems here might actually be worse. There is a company called Ladder Capital, formed out of the remnants of the Bear Stearns bond department, that has struck an unusual deal with Dollar Store, and they have a LOT of properties that are very, very much coasting on made up mortgages. I could easily write like three pages on this one partnership alone, but I'll just summarize instead and say these people learned absolutely nothing from 2008 except that it was a profitable scam that carried no jail time.*

*To understand just how bad the CMBS mess is, you need to understand how CMBS' work. At first glance, they're similar to regular MBS, it's a bundle of tens or hundreds of mortgages for commercial properties, they're divided into tranches (usually six) and the lowest tranches pay out the highest yields but also fail first. And now things get a little complex, so I'm going to simplify like crazy here, but this is the most important part to understand why this is all going to blow up.*

*A commercial building is an income generating property, it's market value is derived from how much income it generates. The bank lending you the money will want you to put up some amount of collateral for the loan. If rents go up, the amount of collateral you have to post goes down. If rent goes down, the amount of collateral you have to post goes UP. Now the weird thing about CMBS loans is that if only half your building is rented, you can just pay half your mortgage and whatever you owe for the other half of the building just gets added to the end of the loan. Now, say you can't rent out the empty half of your building, and you want to renegotiate the terms of your loan rather than just keep adding debt to the back of your loan. Well, this is where the CMBS comes into play, because all those different tranches? The investors behind them have different incentives, the guys at the lowest tranches don't want you to modify the loan, because that means losses, and they take those losses first, while the guys in the highest tranche want to modify the loan because it generates more income for them and they're not eating any losses. Unfortunately for you, in most CMBS agreements you need a supermajority of 70-80% of the votes to get a loan modification.*

*So, to lower rents to market rates and get the building rented out, since you can't get a loan modification, you, the landlord, have to write a check to the bank to make up the difference between the value of the building at the old, higher rental rate and the value of the building at the new, lower rate. Or you can just do nothing, get an extra write off for your taxes, and hope some sucker comes in and rents at the higher price or a different sucker comes along and buys the place from you, making it their problem. This is why you'll see so many empty storefronts with ridiculous asking prices that the landlords won't budge on - it's because they can't.*

*I really, really skimmed just the teeniest top of the surface on this subject, but basically all those CMBS notes that are super toxic start coming due in March of 2022, and they're going to absolutely detonate the commercial property market. Many banks and investment groups will be destroyed when these go bad, just like in 2008.*

[Video of Empty Stores in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqSUhVjS77o)

*This is a video from a guy who just walked around downtown NYC showing all the empty stores and how the place basically looks like a dead mall now.*

*TIMEFRAME: March 2022*

Well, I said March 2022 was when these shit CMBS notes were going to start detonating/causing problems.  Let's check shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

[God that's a big shampoo commercial.](https://preview.redd.it/r77f17nd4kw81.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61734dd411a82c7f1ab2c6d68b750336a9454b9d)

You see that little spike at the end of the head and shoulders before it really dives to new all time lows?  Yeah, that's the last day of February, 2022.  

Ok, so that's 1/3 of the US real estate market, what about the 2/3rds of the market that's residential?  Well, this is where it gets weird, and how everyone (including me) kept missing it.  I've written before about the issues with the US housing market - housing units relative to population has actually increased over the last decade+, while homeownership rates have dropped and prices have skyrocketed.  

Everyone who looks at the residential market thinks its being bought by residents, and that all the people buying today are actually qualified buyers with good credit scores and jobs and such.  And that is true for all the people buying houses.  There is not a repeat of the 2008 sub-prime debacle with NINJA (No Income, No Job, no Assets) loans.  What is new - and whenever you get a financial crisis it's always, ALWAYS driven in large part by a ""new"" type of financial instrument (read debt) - is the sheer number of homes being bought up by with cash, and it's inferred these are all institutions and foreigners.  For example, about $90 billion in US real estate was bought by foreigners in 2021.  Wall Street however, blew that away, hitting as high as 1-in-7 of all homes and 1-in-2 of all apartments.

Now, people look at that record institutional/foreigner buying and think it's the explanation, but the truth is, even with those crazy numbers, 6-in-7 homes and 1-in-2 apartments are still being bought by regular people, often with, again, ""cash"".

These purchases are frequently referred to as ""cash buys"" because the buyer just pays the seller cash.  However, they don't actually have piles of cash lying around in freighters to pay for this stuff.  They take out loans. Specifically, they take out loans on their equity assets.  Now this is where it starts getting sticky, because institutions are not buying these houses and apartments as residences, they're buying them as income generating properties.  

In traditional home mortgage loans, there are two things assessed: the value of the house, which acts as collateral for the loan, and the borrower's ability to pay back said loan via wages or assets.  It's a relatively simple two-factor risk analysis.

Now, let's look at what risks the Wall Street owned rental homes are subject to: income generated/rental rates, housing values, stock/derivative values, interest rates, urban planning, crime rates, and overall market returns.  So basically, the money being loaned is getting assessed on a one-factor risk analysis: value of assets under management (AUM) of the borrower.  But then that money is getting used to buy a whole bunch of houses/apartments, and all of a sudden it's subject to a whole horde of other risks, and the original risk profile is more useless than you are with your compensated evening companionship after a couple drinks.

There's one other thing I haven't mentioned yet, that's huge, and the reason Wall Street never really messed around with buying up everyone's house before the 2008 crash.  And it's a big one:  Liquidity.  More specifically:  Liquidity of Assets.  Lemme say that one more time for the folks in the back recovering from barnyard animal sex gone wrong hearing loss:

# Liquidity of Assets

Wut mean?  Glad you asked 'tard.  Liquidity of Assets (LoA) basically means how easy or hard it is to sell an asset.  Now, one of the reasons wall street hedge funds and investment banks can do things like leverage up at 37.5-1 (the theoretical max level they use) or, say, 200-1 (the level Goldman is at according to the last 13F filing I read) is because the money is backed by securities and derivatives and other financial instruments which are extremely liquid.  So if things go tits up like the Titanic, the lender can force a sell off of this stuff very quickly to get their money back.  Now in reality this isn't true, or Credit Suisse and Nomura wouldn't still be dragging around Archegos bags from last year, and Bill Hwang couldn't have pulled a Reddit meme and avoided margin calls by not answering the phone (yes, that really, actually, in real life, happened).  But in theory, it is.

Now, housing?  Housing is illiquid as fuck.  It takes a lot of time and effort to sell a house.  Or to buy one.  There are special rules and whatnot from the federal government about what kind of collateral and stuff you need for a residential house.  2008 was so bad because the banks basically ignored all of those.  After 2008 one of the few things the government sort-of did fix was tightening up lending standards for retail (regular people), so everyone who's looking at the last crash sees that retail borrowers aren't overleveraged with bad loans and sub-prime and thinks it can't happen again.  But all those rules and whatnot get ignored if the buyer is paying ""cash"".  This is the financial equivalent of the military expression ""Generals always fight the last war"".  

**The massive use of margin/equity backed loans by both retail and institutions to buy property has taken two separate markets, the liquid/volatile equity market, and the illiquid/stable housing market, and stitched them together like a human centipede with dogshit wrapped in catshit debt passing back and forth into one market that is unequally liquid and extremely price volatile.**

If you need proof that this is what's happening, lemme help you out with some charts that illustrate my point:

This is US Margin debt over the last few years

https://preview.redd.it/27i0k94w6pw81.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42eb68f00af67a6afad37582123d3277c940409

Now lets compare it to US home prices over the same period

https://preview.redd.it/5d5qtnvbhpw81.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60e5cbd4091a43a3e437532cb9fa414d4a345d9

So basically, we've got loans on inflated assets fueling loans on other inflated assets.  This is feedback loop that goes parabolic.. then crashes, hard.  You can see the margin debt coming down and forming the first valley before it goes back up a little to complete the Head and Shoulders pattern, then drills down into the center of the earth.  Because housing is illiquid, it's going to lag that drop, but as you can see from the price curve leveling off, it's getting ready to do the same thing.

Now, we know that there are a ton of loans using inflated, volatile collateral on illiquid, inflated assets.  And this is a certified bad thing.  But the coming death spiral of equity/asset sales isn't the only giant elephant in the room everyone is ignoring.  I'm talking of course, about Evergrande in specific and Chinese property bonds in general.

The list of Chinese real estate developers that aren't paying their employees, debts, bonds, or suppliers is actually longer than you pretend your wang is, so we'll just use Evergrande as a proxy for the whole lot of them.

Evergrande hasn't made hundreds of millions of dollars of interest payment on bonds since September.  A couple weeks ago they failed to pay the principal payment on a maturing bond to the tune of $2.1 Billion.  So, you'd think that means their debt is junk and they've defaulted, right?

Not so fast.  Let's check what the big 3 ratings agencies have to say about it:

Fitch:  RD - Restricted Default

S&amp;P: SD - Selective Default

Moody's: Caa1- Rated as Poor Quality and Very High Credit Risk

You notice what's missing from all of those?  ""D"" - Default.  Evergrande has missed everything they can possibly miss, and they're still not rated D.  Hell, those brazen cockchuffers at Moody's actually have 4 separate ratings lower than what they're slapping on EG bonds.  Here, let me take a second to speak in the meme language you smooth brained retards actually might understand:

https://preview.redd.it/dc1p7y99fqw81.jpg?width=849&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7adb931a585d603db30e2b6b8456db353404948

The reason that none of these agencies will put the ""D"" on Evergrande bonds is twofold - 

1: they don't want to piss off the Chinese government

2: the banks and hedge funds that are their primary clients are balls deep in this debt and can't get it off their books because shockingly people haven't forgotten how those same banks and hedge funds fucked, saddled, and rode them with garbage debt in 2008.

Why is this relevant to US housing, equities, and the margin loans financing the spiraling prices of both?  Easy.  The same people who hold the worthless Chinese debt also hold trillions of dollars of equities that they've taken margin loans against to buy trillions of dollars of US Housing.  After Amazon's Q4 earngings, everyone who looked into them said ""Holy crap!  The only thing holding up their ER is this $110 Billion Rivian valuation!""  Some people even made memes about it on WSB pointing out that it was the only thing holding up the entire US market.  Now, what happened when AMZN's Q1 ER came out and the RIVN valuation had dropped to more realistic levels?  Right, a -189% miss on earnings and a huge bear run on SPY and QQQ.  

&gt;!Quick shout out to those of you who like to play options on stock lockup expiries - RIVN's lockup ends on May 8th, and AMZN and F have a ton of shares with a cost basis of $10 they can sell on or after that date.  The price is currently $30.  You do the math on if they want to hold onto that garbage once they can dump it at a profit.!&lt;

That's a huge drop in the collateral backing all that margin debt.  Is it enough to cause the Mother of all Margin Calls (MMC) and set off the worst crash since 1929?  Nope.  Not yet.  But it's coming.  Remember how people pointed out on AMZN's last ER how they were actually super fuk?  Yeah, you know who had a supposedly positive ER but is actually super-mega-fuk and just lied through their teeth about it? Apple.  AAPL doesn't have a single factory working right now, and their by far #1 market - China - is in the midst of complete economic collapse.  &gt;!(the politburo doesn't have emergency meetings about giant spending packages because things are going well)!&lt;  They gave zero guidance on either of these things, which makes me think that it's even worse than I think it is, and I think it's fucking horrible.  But back to the bad Chinese debt. The reason Wall Street can survive a hit to something like AMZN and the indexes is that they're hedged to the balls for stuff like that.  Know what they're not hedged for?  Chinese property bonds universally going to zero.

So what happens when the collateral for those margin loans goes down?  I'm sure you retards behind Wendy's have all heard this one before - you get a margin call.  First, you (or more likely your broker) sells equities.  But if equities are all dropping, they comin' for that money, and they're looking at your assets to get it.  Guess what?  Housing and commercial real estate are both assets they can force sales on.  So that same self-reinforcing spiral that drove up both equity and real estate prices?  It's going to go into reverse, but here's the thing, when everyone is selling at the same time, prices go down really, really, really, really, really, really fast.

We learned this last time in 2008.  This time, because the housing market is directly tied to the crashing stocks, instead of indirectly through people who will default over time as they lose their jobs or balloon payments come due or rates adjust, it's going to happen all at once, faster and more violently.

During this insane rally, the media has tried to script a narrative regarding what we're all doing here and why we're buying GME, and that narrative is far from reality.

BUT.....we are playing right into their hands with all of these 'us against them' and 'I'm not selling, I don't care if I lose my money' style posts. It's actually KILLING us, believe it or not.

Why?

Because that is exactly what the hedge funds want the public to believe - this is simply a bunch of idiots trying to pump a dead stock in the hopes of taking down the shorts.

That narrative is perfect for the HFs because the masses sitting on the sidelines wondering if they should jump in are thinking.....eh, idk. Taking on hedge funds sounds like fun, but these guys always win, the stock just plummeted, I'm not getting involved in that, but I'll root for 'em!

And the fact is, that is NOT what's going on here at all.

We need to stop with the incessant us vs them posts. That's not what we need at all. Is there an us vs them aspect? 100%. Are we trying to change the way the system works and pull back the curtain for the public? Without a doubt.

But the most powerful thing we can do, what will ensure success not only for those currently invested, but for those who join us in helping to bring GME back from the dead is:

WE NEED TO SHARE OUR REASONS FOR LOVING THE COMPANY - OVER AND OVER, CONSTANTLY!!!

I didn't get into this play because of a short squeeze. That's icing on the cake. I got into this play because a savant CEO just took his world class e-commerce infrastructure and turned a 100k company into a $40B company in a few years. And he's coming to GME to do it again.

I got into this play because GME now has Ryan Cohen and his crew, along with Amazon's tech engineer as well as Josh Krueger, who handled fulfillment for Amazon, Walmart, and QVC. Those companies have performed okay, right?

It isn't very often that you have a company with this kind of brand recognition and nostalgia for us 18-50 year olds being reinvented by a team of proven leaders who have shown that they can get the job done better than most. [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) destroyed Amazon in their niche, and that's saying something.

What happens to the stock price when RC comes out and starts to share his vision? What happens when they name him CEO? What happens when the direction of the company starts to become clearer and the numbers begin to back up the potential?

**????????????**  **????????????**  **????????????**  **????????????**  **????????????**  **????????????**  **????????????**

This is an AMAZING value stock. I LOVE IT!!!

If it's worth $800+ in a few years, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.

That all being said, if we constantly post reasons for loving the company, **others will see the value of the company itself and will want to support it's growth**. That's the heart of investing - putting your money behind a company you believe in and want to support because you want to see it grow.

This short squeeze, fast cash, fuck the shorts and stick it to the man narrative **HAS TO CHANGE**. It's not helping anymore and in fact, it's hurting the company severely.

Yes, we want to expose lying, cheating and manipulation. And it wouldn't hurt to see rich, greedy, assholes devoid of empathy get smacked around a bit at the hand of the little guy. Who wouldn't want to see that?

But that's not why I'm supporting GME and I know it's not why most are either. We need to remember that. And if we want to see this company grow and the price of stock rise, we should let the world know why we believe so strongly in it. That's not collusion. It's not organized trading. It's coming together to support a company you love and letting the world know why.

You know what will stop that kind of momentum - **ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING.**

And once the rest of the world sees what we see -

17992,Buy,CLOV,,UnfazedSynergy,n1so1m,310,786,"Hello my fellow retards, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action.

As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:

* The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500 were all up by EOD.
* MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD.

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart of CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/byclt37gzaw61.png?width=3766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=156907323ac0c10051c6051276d9d110e5c4640c)

**Fibonacci retracements:**

Looking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34.

If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more.

With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon.

As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other:**

* Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment.
* RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI.
* Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase.
* All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap.

**Conclusion:**

All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.

Citron said in his video that a squeeze canƒ??t happen if insiders keep selling, but insiders (likely) CAN NOT sell company issued stock because of end of fiscal quarter lockup/blackout period, which usually extends until earnings are reported (which is on 3/26!!)

TLDR - no insider selling means more ???????????????????? fuel because paper handed insiders canƒ??t give in to the shorts even if they wanted to.

Alright listen up. I did a quick search on WSB and didnƒ??t see any hits actually talking about what is known as a ƒ??quiet periodƒ? or ƒ??blackoutƒ? for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.

You NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).

Iƒ??m assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Hereƒ??s a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.

Obligatory disclaimer: Iƒ??m not a financial advisor and I am long GME.

First: what is stock based compensation?

This is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.

options - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. Youƒ??ll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.

RSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.

PRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.

Almost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you canƒ??t take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.

From the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so youƒ??ll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.

Second: how do companies ensure these incentives donƒ??t hurt them or other shareholders?

This is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. 

This is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.

Now, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, thatƒ??s insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.

To protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.

READ: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.

This is almost certainly why you donƒ??t see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.

In practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.

READ: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts canƒ??t cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.

Since these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.

SUMMARY
Citron said short squeeze canƒ??t happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) canƒ??t sell because of end of quarter blackout. 

This should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts. Anyone else on here who has dealt with stock based comp, please do sanity check me here and Iƒ??m happy to edit and refine.

* Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti-China campaign. Nokia has since netted around 40%-50% of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors.

* Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line. This is now all changing and ReefShark (management's answer to this mistake) is now taking off. ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company. 75% rollout by EOY 2021. 100% by EOY 2022.

* The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark. This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality. He is significantly more competent than the last CEO, Rajeev Suri, meaning the company's future is probably stable for now. Unfortunately, Pekka is also an old dog, you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon.

* There is some price erosion in the North American market, meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here - leading to reduced margins for Nokia. In addition, the U.S. dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro, thanks to free money from the federal reserve - leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia. Every other market has remained relatively stable.

**The Bull Case:**

* ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021. This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ.

* Nokia OYJ is a profitable company, a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays.

* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.

* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.

* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any ""early bird"" advantage.

* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.

* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.

* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.

* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.

**The Bear Case:**

* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.

* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?

* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. 

**Summary Recommendations:**

**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.

**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of ""price erosion"" and ""difficult year"" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground. All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound.","NOK NOK, WHOSE THERE?",44240.73409,t3_ljdboy,"NOK NOK, WHOSE THERE? **Current Status Report:**

* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.

* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.

* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any ""early bird"" advantage.

* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.

* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.

* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.

* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.

**The Bear Case:**

* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.

* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?

* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. 

**Summary Recommendations:**

**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.

**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of ""price erosion"" and ""difficult year"" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground.

Profit taking and volatile swings brought the shares down to a modest close of ""only"" up 57% at $31.40. u/DeepFuckingValue, who has titanium alloy diamond hands (now known as DFV hands) posted an update and to the surprise of no one, is still holding his 1,000 contracts of Jan 15 $20c on Wednesday afternoon. (Note: He took gains on the contracts today though I'm not sure at what point in the day while keeping his April $12c).

* The pump action resumed for GME this Thursday morning with premarket pushing the underlying back to $38 once again and commenced to another wild session of large movements. Initially trading around $34 to $36 in morning, GME started to rip once again when noon struck and ran as high as $43 for the day. GME closed the day up 27% to $40. If you're STILL not in GME, these back-to-back days have pushed IV to new highs and even OTM contracts months out will be commanding large premium (~160%+ IV for April and 140%+ for July). Proceed with caution (who am I kidding just go all in).

* Morning economic numbers: jobless claims continues its dismal trend, with first-time claims hitting 965k last week vs the consensus of 800k (oof). Last week's total was 784k. As with before, market did not react to the numbers cuz its PrIcEd iN. Import prices rose 0.9 in Dec vs 0.6 expected.

* Jpow spoke at 12:30 PM today in a Princeton Uni session and reaffirmed what everyone has largely expected: rates will continue to be low and while the Feds will raise rate eventually, Jpow says that its ""no time soon"" given economic situation.

* Are they big tech or big cuck? The market reversed course and big tech continues their sell off, with MSFT, AAPL, NFLX, and AMZN all retreating more than -1% as yet another sector rotation commenced. Payment providers got an extra dose of sell-off with V closing at -3.43% and MA closing at -5.25%, despite both having positive PT from Deutsche Bank today with V having a PT increase of $270 from $220 and MA PT increase of $420 from $383.

* Small caps performed strongly today as money flow throughout the day into ""value"" grabs. RUT/IWM closed the day up 2%. Notable underlyings beyond GME are BBBY (up 18.77%), MIK (up 9.6%), M (up 5%), WSM (up 4%), and KIRK (up 9.58%).

* In WSB meme stock land MT continues in its channel, gaining 2.95% today to close at $24.81 PLTR got hit with another downgrade, this time via Citi as the analysts believes the stock is vulnerable to a few upcoming catalyst, including lockup expiry and an deceleration in growth. PT for Citi is $15 (don't worry tho surely WSB is ""in control"" with this stock too). PLUG drilled more than -5.74% during intraday low as JPM initiated with a neutral rating and downgraded sector competitor FCEL. PLUG closed the day down -4.26% to $64.63 while FCEL closed the day down -8% to $17.60, fending off intraday low of more than -12%. ICLN, the clean tech ETF continues its range bound trading and will likely require a clear catalyst in terms of what the $2 tril stimulus actually entails to move further. Buckle up, loser.

* Despite being green most of the day, major indexes retreated to red as power hour neared. Indexes went red and lost all its morning gains as the sell-off accelerated into closing hours. DOW closed the day down -0.22% or -69 pts, IXIC closed down -0.12% or -16 pts, SPX closed -0.38% or -14 pts, and RUT closed up 2% or 43 pts. While the retreat was modest compare to yesterday's close, the intraday reversal was quite jarring esp if you're trading FDs (and let's face it, you definitely were loading up on those Jan 1/15 calls).

* Earning season will soon be upon us and the first wave are starting later this week. Tomorrow morning financials kick things off as WFC, JPM, and C are all reporting before market opens. If banks shat the bed, expect a pounding for the Dow given how large of a component they are still to the stupid index. Expectations are fairly high as JPM has had a flurry of upgrades in the past few days with PT of $150 from Piper Sandler, $152 from Jefferies, and an upgrade to buy from neutral at BofA.

* Biden will unveil his $2 tril stimulus package/plan in a speech later tonight at 7:15 PM ET. Please pump those green tech cuz I have an embarrassing amount in SPAC/EVs.

* They just got a whole lot cheaper and the average pleb will be all over that shit.
* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.
* No one dares to short Musk and Cook, because they will get cucked. Again.
* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.
* Battery day for TSLA and ARM based computers from AAPL coming soon.
* If people wanted to lock in gains, they would have done so on Friday.
* StOnKs OnLy gO uP.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.

* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.
* No one dares to short Musk and Cook, because they will get cucked. Again.
* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.

20852,Buy,CLOV,,bittabet,o672a9,253,1621,"Hi everybody, I've decided to finally try and write up a more in depth DD for CLOV because I think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model, and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America. For some background, I'm an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics-essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take (I actually did about 2/3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater). So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish, and I'm going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does.

# What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created?

To understand Clover's business model we first need to understand what ***Medicare Advantage*** is, because that's Clover's primary business model (though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar). Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US.

Have you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person [**have more than doubled in the last decade?**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA)  Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and [have worsened wealth inequality](https://www.ft.com/content/0d7ea0c1-f0b8-4c8a-a532-f18f147079bc) due to growing 5X since 1980, but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we're going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity.

Right now, literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs, from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies. Focusing on insurance though, the crazy thing is that **insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money.**

Wait a minute you say, ""That makes no sense! Why would insurance companies make more money if they're paying out more money?"" That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the [80/20 rule](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rate-review/), a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance. You'll often see this referred to as a ""Medical Loss Ratio"" especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies. But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20% of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80%.

So what did health insurance companies do? With this new law it meant that every insurance company was **now aligned with** ***higher*** **payouts to hospitals, physicians and pharmacies** and [stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145008/) because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year. That's become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues. Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a big part of why [United Healthcare stock has rocketed up in a straight line up for the last decade-up more than 1300% since Obamacare passed in 2010.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/UNH#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-)

Now, most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work. But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65. The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind-where patients have a stroke, have a heart attack, get cancer, and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures. As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well. Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies. Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients, the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers. So the more patients a health insurance companies has, the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients. This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits. Now you're going to think, doesn't that just mean they'll just deny paying for everything and make bank? No, because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get, and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient. This is the government's attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system.

# Why Clover Health?

So now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is. Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they've been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer? What it comes down to are two things.

**1)** **Clover Health is a ""pure"" play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover's profitability.** Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Direct Contracting (to avoid this being 80 pages long, this is a type of  hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction). This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality, preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized, preventing patients from having those heart attacks, strokes, cancer. If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you're less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare. If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they'd actually make less and less money due to the 80/20 rule! So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they'll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed. Any company that's attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself, either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business. They can't actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different. With Clover, if they succeed it's literally a win for everyone. It's a win for shareholders with larger profits, it's a win for patients because they have better health, it's a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy, it's a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system [ranked last place against similar nations](https://www.citizen.org/article/dead-last-u-s-health-care-system-continues-to-rank-behind-other-industrialized-countries/).

**2) Clover Assistant**. This is the killer app that Clover has been working on, it's their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner. For example, a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home, but they're supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they're continuing to improve, that they're not getting worse again. In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week. The patient may or may not read this, and even if they do they'll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they're not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up. 2 weeks later, the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911, ends up back in the emergency room, back in the hospital. [Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program) but it's still a rampant problem. With Clover Assistant however, the software is constantly looking at every patient's record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey, you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they're continuing to get better. Then their physician might intervene with something like a $20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve, instead of yet another $20,000 hospitalization. That's just one example of what it can already do today, but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare.

# Addressing short seller critiques

To be frank, the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business. But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I'm going to address the points they bring up.

**#1 Claim: Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice.**

Clover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice, which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring. This doesn't mean that there's any actual fraud, but it's standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up. There's no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health's performance. As an example, where was Hindenburg's short report when [Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018?](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-doj-medicare-advantage-risk-adjustment-chart-review-civil-investigative-demand) If we [take a look at Anthem's stock during this same time period](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/ANTM#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--) we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price, and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70%! It's absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision. They pitch it as an ""existential risk"", essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer. [Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/health_care/clover-health-taps-former-cms-official-for-board/article_51803ebc-e162-596b-a372-d7907d6abe7a.html) which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare.

**#2 Claim: Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare**, a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover's head of sales.

This claim just has no factual basis, the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non-Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them.  Regardless, Clover has made it clear on Seek's website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs.

**#3 Claim: Clover's software tries to ""upcode""**

If you're not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative, but what Clover's software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does. Medicare billing codes can be coded higher (meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare) based on how much data you've included about a patient in your documentation. Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x-rays, labwork, etc. to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there. That's a large part of their business plan, because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care. Hindenburg makes it sound like they're doing something nefarious when in fact, reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care. Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don't know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data-free documentation. That'd be beyond moronic.

**#4 Claim: Doctor's whine about Clover's software.**

So coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems. I'm sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant, but the part they're not telling you is that a [third of physicians are over the age of 60.](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physician-retirement-why-its-hard-doctors-retire) There is no software in existence that isn't going to be whined about by physicians, it doesn't matter if it's Allscripts, Epic, whatever, the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with. If you've ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I'm talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid.

**#5 Claim: Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money.**

Hindenburg tries to spin this as a negative, that doctors are getting paid $200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant. Well, in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant. Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model. **Studies show that** [**every $1 extra spent on primary care is going to save $12 down the line**](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/delivering-value-healthcare-starts-increased-primary-care-investment). This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies, they're going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more, so they can spend more time with each patient, **so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that'll prevent more health problems down the line**. Hindenburg doesn't actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover's Medicare Advantage business model here, which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all.

**#6 Claim: Clover's CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money.**

I could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down. But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller ***spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative***. I honestly can't think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say.  Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else, and now with Clover he's going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank.

# Short term price catalysts/Short Squeeze prospects

This is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it. I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold. Chamath thinks it's one of the most obvious 10-baggers he's ever seen and frankly I agree, but let's break down the short term.

Short Interest: Over the last few weeks SI has been 40-50% of the float. I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified, and the SI being even higher but it's not clear to me that this is the case. Nonetheless, [Ortex is looking into this](https://twitter.com/trades_dutch/status/1406999851313807362) so we'll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough. It really doesn't matter that much though, this is extremely highly shorted. When VW underwent their infinity squeeze **the SI was only 12%**, what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn't cover their position-that matters much more than the exact number the SI% is. 40-50% is honestly a massive number that's more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur.

**Why did the price just jump?**

Now here's the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now. If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it's because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk, but that's not the reason. Obviously WSB has obviously thought it's a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid.

The reason is simply that 6/22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow. A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6/18. How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days. That's known as T+2 settlement, which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US. So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares. Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T+1 settlement, meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6/22 was Monday 6/21. So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday, which is pretty much what you saw happen. But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options.

Now if you think about it, why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off? It's because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame. So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank. By 4PM on 6/22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9%.

Regardless, that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it's going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position. Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now [(100/100 at S3)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404880301428547585?s=19). I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply.

# Long term value

This is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn't currently generate profits they're an incredibly fast growing company. If they manage to achieve what they're trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit, because we're talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year. Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant. The EHR business could become another multi-billion dollar business alone. Allscripts is worth $2.5 billion and Epic is worth more but it's privately held. It's going to be years of work before Clover grows to a massive size and scale but I think if it does happen then Chamath's 10-bagger estimate is going to look conservative.

# Positions or ban

I [doubled down on my YOLO before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nr6rpz/clov_yolo_part_2_the_double_down/) but with the drop to the $11's on Monday I've added another 25,000 shares and now hold 98888 shares of CLOV. Ironically, I started buying CLOV trying to find a stock that was heavily undervalued and was going to put $100K into it. Now my attempt at building a diversified value portfolio with $1 million has somehow turned into this insanity but hey, I guess I've spent too much time here.",CLOV detailed DD,44370.01307,t3_o672a9,"CLOV detailed DD Hi everybody, I've decided to finally try and write up a more in depth DD for CLOV because I think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model, and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America. For some background, I'm an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics-essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take (I actually did about 2/3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater). So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish, and I'm going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does.

# What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created?

To understand Clover's business model we first need to understand what ***Medicare Advantage*** is, because that's Clover's primary business model (though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar). Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US.

Have you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person [**have more than doubled in the last decade?**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA)  Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and [have worsened wealth inequality](https://www.ft.com/content/0d7ea0c1-f0b8-4c8a-a532-f18f147079bc) due to growing 5X since 1980, but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we're going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity.

Right now, literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs, from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies. Focusing on insurance though, the crazy thing is that **insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money.**

Wait a minute you say, ""That makes no sense! Why would insurance companies make more money if they're paying out more money?"" That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the [80/20 rule](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rate-review/), a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance. You'll often see this referred to as a ""Medical Loss Ratio"" especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies. But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20% of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80%.

So what did health insurance companies do? With this new law it meant that every insurance company was **now aligned with** ***higher*** **payouts to hospitals, physicians and pharmacies** and [stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145008/) because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year. That's become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues. Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a big part of why [United Healthcare stock has rocketed up in a straight line up for the last decade-up more than 1300% since Obamacare passed in 2010.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/UNH#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-)

Now, most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work. But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65. The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind-where patients have a stroke, have a heart attack, get cancer, and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures. As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well. Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies. Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients, the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers. So the more patients a health insurance companies has, the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients. This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits. Now you're going to think, doesn't that just mean they'll just deny paying for everything and make bank? No, because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get, and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient. This is the government's attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system.

# Why Clover Health?

So now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is. Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they've been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer? What it comes down to are two things.

**1)** **Clover Health is a ""pure"" play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover's profitability.** Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Direct Contracting (to avoid this being 80 pages long, this is a type of  hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction). This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality, preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized, preventing patients from having those heart attacks, strokes, cancer. If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you're less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare. If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they'd actually make less and less money due to the 80/20 rule! So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they'll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed. Any company that's attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself, either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business. They can't actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different. With Clover, if they succeed it's literally a win for everyone. It's a win for shareholders with larger profits, it's a win for patients because they have better health, it's a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy, it's a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system [ranked last place against similar nations](https://www.citizen.org/article/dead-last-u-s-health-care-system-continues-to-rank-behind-other-industrialized-countries/).

**2) Clover Assistant**. This is the killer app that Clover has been working on, it's their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner. For example, a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home, but they're supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they're continuing to improve, that they're not getting worse again. In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week. The patient may or may not read this, and even if they do they'll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they're not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up. 2 weeks later, the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911, ends up back in the emergency room, back in the hospital. [Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program) but it's still a rampant problem. With Clover Assistant however, the software is constantly looking at every patient's record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey, you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they're continuing to get better. Then their physician might intervene with something like a $20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve, instead of yet another $20,000 hospitalization. That's just one example of what it can already do today, but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare.

# Addressing short seller critiques

To be frank, the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business. But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I'm going to address the points they bring up.

**#1 Claim: Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice.**

Clover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice, which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring. This doesn't mean that there's any actual fraud, but it's standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up. There's no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health's performance. As an example, where was Hindenburg's short report when [Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018?](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-doj-medicare-advantage-risk-adjustment-chart-review-civil-investigative-demand) If we [take a look at Anthem's stock during this same time period](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/ANTM#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--) we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price, and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70%! It's absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision. They pitch it as an ""existential risk"", essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer. [Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/health_care/clover-health-taps-former-cms-official-for-board/article_51803ebc-e162-596b-a372-d7907d6abe7a.html) which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare.

**#2 Claim: Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare**, a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover's head of sales.

This claim just has no factual basis, the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non-Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them.  Regardless, Clover has made it clear on Seek's website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs.

**#3 Claim: Clover's software tries to ""upcode""**

If you're not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative, but what Clover's software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does. Medicare billing codes can be coded higher (meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare) based on how much data you've included about a patient in your documentation. Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x-rays, labwork, etc. to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there. That's a large part of their business plan, because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care. Hindenburg makes it sound like they're doing something nefarious when in fact, reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care. Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don't know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data-free documentation. That'd be beyond moronic.

**#4 Claim: Doctor's whine about Clover's software.**

So coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems. I'm sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant, but the part they're not telling you is that a [third of physicians are over the age of 60.](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physician-retirement-why-its-hard-doctors-retire) There is no software in existence that isn't going to be whined about by physicians, it doesn't matter if it's Allscripts, Epic, whatever, the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with. If you've ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I'm talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid.

**#5 Claim: Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money.**

Hindenburg tries to spin this as a negative, that doctors are getting paid $200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant. Well, in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant. Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model. **Studies show that** [**every $1 extra spent on primary care is going to save $12 down the line**](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/delivering-value-healthcare-starts-increased-primary-care-investment). This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies, they're going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more, so they can spend more time with each patient, **so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that'll prevent more health problems down the line**. Hindenburg doesn't actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover's Medicare Advantage business model here, which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all.

**#6 Claim: Clover's CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money.**

I could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down. But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller ***spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative***. I honestly can't think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say.  Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else, and now with Clover he's going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank.

# Short term price catalysts/Short Squeeze prospects

This is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it. I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold. Chamath thinks it's one of the most obvious 10-baggers he's ever seen and frankly I agree, but let's break down the short term.

Short Interest: Over the last few weeks SI has been 40-50% of the float. I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified, and the SI being even higher but it's not clear to me that this is the case. Nonetheless, [Ortex is looking into this](https://twitter.com/trades_dutch/status/1406999851313807362) so we'll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough. It really doesn't matter that much though, this is extremely highly shorted. When VW underwent their infinity squeeze **the SI was only 12%**, what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn't cover their position-that matters much more than the exact number the SI% is. 40-50% is honestly a massive number that's more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur.

**Why did the price just jump?**

Now here's the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now. If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it's because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk, but that's not the reason. Obviously WSB has obviously thought it's a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid.

The reason is simply that 6/22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow. A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6/18. How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days. That's known as T+2 settlement, which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US. So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares. Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T+1 settlement, meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6/22 was Monday 6/21. So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday, which is pretty much what you saw happen. But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options.

Now if you think about it, why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off? It's because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame. So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank. By 4PM on 6/22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9%.

Regardless, that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it's going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position. Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now [(100/100 at S3)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404880301428547585?s=19). I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply.

# Long term value

This is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn't currently generate profits they're an incredibly fast growing company. If they manage to achieve what they're trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit, because we're talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year. Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant. The EHR business could become another multi-billion dollar business alone. Allscripts is worth $2.5 billion and Epic is worth more but it's privately held. It's going to be years of work before Clover grows to a massive size and scale but I think if it does happen then Chamath's 10-bagger estimate is going to look conservative.

This is a descending channel dating back to February. During the week of 6/1 - we managed to break it up. You will notice many other ""meme"" stocks broke a similar setup recently before launching. Notice the gap right at **31.30.** Gaps in the upper direction are (almost) always filled. We can logically conclude the goal of this descending channel break is to finally fill that gap - before deciding the next move.

**(TEAL)**

Here we have an ascending wedge coming from upside. These patterns have a bullish bias. It's not uncommon to see a small wedge/channel form on the breakout from a larger pattern. In fact - it's actually quite bullish. If we get a daily close above the upper teal line - sitting around **25.87** on Monday - it would then ""break out"", and likely trigger a much more volatile move towards that gap at **31.34.**

**(GREEN)**

Volume is trending upwards as the ascending wedge trends upwards. This is supportive of the trend and a bullish data point.

**(YELLOW)**

These are key price levels near the setup. When we are below, they are resistance - when we are above, they are support. As you can see - the nearest support below the wedge isn't until **22.70.** On a failed breakout - it's likely we don't stop dropping until we hit this. For the upside - the nearest resistance isn't until **29.94 -** this is actually a thick supply zone with multiple levels. While it's likely we go the distance and fill that gap at **31.34 -** I would unload a good bit of your position at this resistance.

\---

**(ENTRIES)**

There are two optimal entries for this setup -

1. On a trip to that point of control @ **24.53.** This is where the most business has been done in the past year and buyers/sellers like to reposition here. It's also the **low end of the wedge** \- which means below this (on a daily close) - you would look to exit, if you took this entry. This provides a very tight and favorable margin of error.
2. On a daily candle close above that upper teal line - @ **25.87** Monday - sloping up each day by about **0.06**. You would then stop out if we got a daily candle close below that same line - also providing a nice margin of error.

**(EXITS)**

1. If you took entry 1 - you would stop out on a daily candle close below **24.53.**
2. If you took entry 2 - you would stop out on a daily candle close below the teal line around **25.87** Monday sloping up each day by about **0.06.**

Both entries would target **29.94** (take 3/4 off) and then that gap at **31.34** (I would exit here).

I started with 1 share at $350 so I could say I was here.

Now I got 15, aps $161.

I had no idea about the whole GME thing until last week.

I  bought the first share as a lotto ticket. The last two were the easiest shares Iƒ??ve ever bought.

I hope the squeeze happens, but if not, I still consider this an investment Iƒ??m happy to make. And thatƒ??s how I consider it now, an Investment.

I bought a lotto ticket on GameStop stock, realized I own shares in this phenomenon called $GME, and bought more.

GameStop is the videogame store that the slowest, flakiest weed dealer in the Chicagoland area worked at back when I was in Highschool.

$GME? I canƒ??t define $GME because right now...it is simply *beyond.*

$GME is at the center of a movement that got support from AOC and Ted Cruz...AT THE SAME TIME IN 2021!!!!

$GME has been given the most aggressive, effective, and expansive advertising campaign in the history of anything...for free. Communist dictators struggle getting the same amount of coverage...in their own regimes!

$GME hasƒ??

\-A fucking $NFLX movie already optioned!

\-Mass news coverage, worldwide, real or not.

\-The FUCKING INTERNET

\-The rocket emoji (WTF else could it be associated with now?)

\-Customers buying and donating $GME products to charity.

\-People buying Billboards, all over the world. A free street team for everywhere!

\-Peoples. $GME could have more than brand loyalty, it has the possibility to ƒ??have peoples.ƒ? Like Applefolk. I really hope they donƒ??t fuck this up. I hope to continue being a fan.

\*\*\*\*And if there are any $GME Execs who think something like ƒ??Well I wouldnƒ??t call that advertiƒ??ƒ? Then my entire thesis is wrong. But after reading Ryan Cohen's letter to the Board, Iƒ??d be surprised that someone who thinks that way would still hold any position of influence at $GME.

$GME Has MONEY with VISION. Have you read Cohenƒ??s letter? I think I read it once two days ago after seeing DFV mention it in one of his posts. I read it again earlier today, but this time after having read Cubanƒ??s AMA. That was critical. Between Cohenƒ??s letter and Cubanƒ??s wisdom, something happened. I ACTUALLY- LIKE DEEP IN MY SOUL- BEGAN TO LIKE THE STOCK!!!

So I stopped trying to daytrade FDƒ??s to average down shares, and took a more intentional look at $GMEƒ??s story and plan moving forward.

$GME should be so much more than a video game store, in the same way that McDonaldƒ??s is so much more than a fastfood restaurant. Itƒ??s like when Harry Sonneborn went to Ray Crock and was like ƒ??Bro, you ainƒ??t a restaurant owner, youƒ??re a FUCKING REALESTATE MAGNATE!.ƒ? Ray didnƒ??t know what he had... the template for a business that wouldnƒ??t just disrupt the casual dining industry...it would DEFINE it.**WHO THE FUCK IS THE MACDONALDS OF GAMING?!**

$GME is in a position to wipe out EVERYONE in one of the fastest growing industries in the world. We donƒ??t even know how the video gaming is going to mature as an industry yet, just that itƒ??s gonna be bigger than it already is.

Cohen knows this, DFV knows this, any of you who have been truly following GME before the circus began prolly came to the same conclusion.

And Cuban knows this, but I think he saw something bigger.

Did anyone wonder why one of the most prolific and popular billionaires in the whole world might expose himself to possible legal or PR disaster, just so he can do an AMA on one of the most politically incorrect discussion forums on the net, at a time when itƒ??s being watched like hawk by fin regulators? Not only that, afterwards, he goes on a PR crusade in support of WSB!!!

Why? **Because this is the place to be.**

And this pushes all those assets and ideas listed above to whole new level.

There may be something WAAAAAAYYY bigger than a squeeze, a turn around, or even the advent of a gaming empire. Mass Media hysteria, AOC and Cruz agreeing, dogs and cats living together! Thereƒ??s something bigger thatƒ??s possible, and Iƒ??m not sure Cuban even knows what it is, just that itƒ??s BIG and since heƒ??s Mark Fucking Cuban...he made sure he was in it, but even more so, took a side and defended a conviction...For what? a bunch of tards chasing a squeeze? A chance to look cool in front of millennials? FUCK NO!...AND DOUBLE FUCK NO TO THE SECOND ONE!

We were all looking at charts, wondering what lines do, and scouring the sub looking for reassurance and more retarded DD, that I think we missed the value of $GMEƒ??s newest asset:

**#GME fanatics and the Social and Cultural phenomenon they started.**

What is the possible financial gain from the spirit (Geist) of the Squeeze ? I have no idea, but $GME is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out. And this sparks joy and wonder in my soul.

Iƒ??m grateful to all the work DFV has done, but I'm also grateful he is no longer posting updates. The pressure on that man to hold...HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN? Thatƒ??s the only comment for like the first 1k comments!!! It was to the point where actual lives could have been at stake if he didnƒ??t post an update, let alone a stock price. Have you watched his vids? Have you seen how fucking chill and cool he is? It's insane to think about the weight he carried.

Nonetheless, Iƒ??m in because I like the stock. Thatƒ??s it. But I like to think DFV has similar ideas to those explained above, and will continue to hold for the same reason. I also like to think thereƒ??s a few VCƒ??s out there with similar thoughts. Maybe a few billionaires that are looking for something that can be truly Good and new.

Lastly, All of the radical and possibly delusional assumptions I made to come to this conclusion might be absolutely wrong.

TLDR: I actually like the stock. ",$GME has a MAJOR asset that's being overlooked...The Geist of the Squeeze,44230.86134,t3_lc6lqr,"$GME has a MAJOR asset that's being overlooked...The Geist of the Squeeze (FROM THE HEART)

The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.
In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms. 
Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.

In 1978, Queen released ""Don't Stop Me Now"", which prophesized several key events of Virgin Galactics climb to glory, and the inevitability of its success, along with a hidden message to future generations encoded in its release date.

""Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time"" Clearly here you can see the many weekends of strippers and blow which are being funded,and will continue to be funded by Virgin Galactics ATHs, especially when they fall on fridays.

""I feel alive, and the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah... and floating around in ecstasy""
What makes you feel more alive than that blow and those strippers? These two catalysts will drive more and more money to invest still more in SPCE, just to get more tendies to fuel their addictions.

""So dont stop me now dont stop me... Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time.""
The warning to bears, that their negative party killing vibes will not be tolerated.

""I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky... like a tiger defying the laws of gravity... I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva... I'm gonna go, go, go... there's no stopping me""
The first of the clear allusions to a spaceship company. Their rockets will leap through the sky like shooting stars, defying the laws of Gravity, racing by at high speed, and you cannot stop this from happening.

""I'm burning through the sky, yeah... two hundred degrees.. Thats why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit... I'm traveling at the speed of light... I wanna make a supersonic man out of you""
Getting even more clear, and prophesying the arrival of hypersonic flight, a goal and what would be a major revenue stream for Virgin Galactic. The outside skin of a spaceship gets very hot at hypersonic speeds, and they want to make a supersonic man out of you. The speed of light reference was just AIDS, sorry.


""Dont stop me now, I'm having such a good time... I'm having a ball... Dont stop me now... If you wanna have a good time just give me a call... Dont stop me now... Dont stop me now... I dont wanna stop at all""
More cocaine and strippers. If you wanna have a good time, give him a call and he'll tell you how to get on the SPCE train.

""Yeah, I'm a rocketship on the way to Mars... On a collision course... I am a satellite, I'm out of control... I am a sex machine ready to reload... Like an atom bomb about to... Oh, oh, oh, explode""

The last line of relavance in the song, before Freddie is forced to resort to choruses and repeats of the same theme in order to ensure this song's popularity, and survival to be of use to us. It cant be more clear. This stock will go to the moon and beyond, but will be high risk once it hits Mars.

Now, I'm sure you're sold on my reasoning now, but wondering why I think this is a prediction of Virgin Galactic and not an IPO of SpaceX or Blue Origin. This is for two reasons. Virgin Galactic is led by SIR Richard Branson. Queens very name was a clue that one of their knights would shower us in tendies. 

As for the message hidden in the date? Virgin Galactic will begin operations this year, 42 years from the year this song was released. 42. The answer to life, the universe, and everything.

*^(You'll need to enable macro, needed to run Black Scholes functions, I promise no virii inside)*

So based on  the market close data of 3/3/21, using options data up to the 3/19 expiry, the net delta hedged shares by MMs stands at 6,852,559 \*(\*\*^(If we assume most MMs try to be delta neutral)\*). And if $GME price were  to increase to 200$, they would need to buy an additional 6,261,580 shares

Now suppose you want to see what happens when someone buy 20,000 of 3/12 200 calls. Go the EXPIRY2\_CALLS sheet and edit the Open Interest of the options

is now 6,825,991 vs 6,261,580 previously, an increase of 564,411 shares. So a call option worth 20,000 x 5.2 x 100 = 10,400,000$, if the stock price increased from 124.8 to 200 (in 1 day) would have triggered an added 564,411 shares delta hedged (rough approximation), which was worth 564,411 x 124.8 = 70,438,492$ if bought outright, giving an amplification factor of roughly 7:1.(^(not using tick data to forecast price increase vs buying volume)) One common misconception is that if a call becomes ITM near expiry, MMs would have already bought &gt;90% of it in delta hedge, however  for a high IV like $GME, its closer to 60%.

Anyway here it is again, with puts Open Interest included.

I've seen a lot of DDs repeating similar assumptions on gamma squeeze/delta hedging without actually providing accurate calculation on it; And it seemed, with the 7 million plus influx of new members to wsb, a large portion of  newcomers don't know the option's greeks yet. ***Thus, the reason for this post is to enable everyone here in wsb, to calculate the gamma squeeze effect for themselves(rough approximation), instead of relying on random DDs figures.***

The attached excel sheet allows you to model squeeze scenarios

  **Cannabis stocks rally on Biden pardon for pot possession, study of Schedule I status of cannabis**

(MarketWatch) -- Shares of cannabis companies rallied Thursday after President Joe Biden said he would pardon federal offenders for simple pot possession. Biden also asked for a review on marijuana's current status as a Schedule 1 controlled substance under U.S. law. U.S. cannabis companies listed on the OTC as well as Canadian cannabis companies moved up sharply. Curaleaf Holdings Inc. jumped 37%, Tilray Brands Inc. rallied 22.8%, Trulieve Cannabis Corp. moved up by 33.8%, Canopy Growth Corp. rose 15.7%, Verano Holdings Corp. rose 9%, and Cresco Labs advanced by 26.4%. The Cannabis ETF rose 3.7% and the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF rose 18.7%.

EDIT 2: Everyone commenting emotionally charged oppositions to my opinion, please post proof of your current GME cost basis with your angry comment.

#Why is every bearish speculative view on GME now considered Melvin propoganda? Check my fucking post history, dipshits. I'm allowed to have a bearish short term outlook for a stock that I'm long term bullish on especially when my initial cost basis is probably 1/10 what yours is.

1. Constantly moving price targets alone is a huge indicator that were topping a crest.  In the last 1 month I've seen the price target move from $240-$500 to a ""serious"" $10,000/shr..

2. This sub is FILLED with emotional trading which is the complete opposite of what WSB was founded on. It's all about the money and it's ALWAYS been all about the money. Cry me a river about unfairness... The market was ""rigged"" when the money printers were going brrrrr back in may and WSB was made up of 90% people WHO WERE SHORTING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY.

3. The amount of people with outdated news at this stage in the game will show you who the bagholders will be. They weren't quick enough to jump on the band wagon at $40/shr, what makes them think they'll be able to perfectly time a single (or half) day event?

4. Mr. Shrek (the one and only posterchild and ACTUAL WSB mod) is short term bearish on GME and doesn't even hold a position. And he's locked up and talking through a contact. That should tell you something about the current bagholders.

TL;DR don't be a shoe shine boy. There's a psychological reason that the ones who are slowest to jump aboard are the ones left holding the bag.

John Galt, if you're out there, I'm waiting for my invite.

The hedgefund guys are billionares. If there's one thing they know how to do, it's make money with legal/illegal/immoral practices. If you're not willing to stoop to that level, then you're at a disadvantage.

***I think*** we're in the greater fool stage. Maybe you'll be able to sell if the stock opens at $500 OR maybe you'll eat shit if it gaps down to $200. Either way, you need a plan, and that plan should not include the word ""hope"". What gain/loss are you willing to take; whats the mathematical probability that will happen; and what are you going to do about it whichever way it goes?.

What a fucking amazing session. ????????I would say an historic day that will never be forgotten, congrats to the all the Rets and Autss who stuck with GME. ????????All they ever wanted was some tendies and ketchup and now they can get some.  I was soooo close to jumping in to some 0DTE GMEs when it was still read and got distracted. Oh well. 

Meanwhile BB was red red red ƒ??ƒ??ƒ??, some folks were crying and getting shaky and had to be reminded that the path to profits is never a straight line. RED IS PART OF THE PROCESS. When the GME halt hit I knew cash would start to spray around, and possibly to BB, which hallelujah, it did.

7106,Sell,GME,,Unlucky-Prize,kxb7dy,351,203,"There was some action in another thread about this, but thought I'd summarize my math on possible dealer/MM forced selling friday. **At present, it appears that  as many as 15.3m shares of GME will get dumped between now and the close Friday, and GME has float of 46m shares. This is essentially the reverse of yesterday, when I believe banks/dealers/mms essentially bought a good fraction of that, or maybe even a bit more using longer option exposures, on the way up, causing the huge melt up we saw.**

**I'm not saying GME is a bad or good stock, and I'm not saying Cohen's plan is good or bad. I'm not saying there isn't a future further short squeeze. I'm just saying that a massive block of selling may occur Friday on dealer hedging behaviors. And I am saying congratulations to all the longs who made a ton of money here (I certainly did earlier).**

Anyway, I went through and counted all of the open interest of all options expiring on GME friday - calls and puts - and then multiplied that by deltas when GME stock at $40. It's changed a bit since then. I used yahoo finance data, which may be slightly stale and cause some inaccuracy here. 

Assumption: 90% of all calls and puts have a dealer on the short side hedging. If there are more named thetagang sellers, the implications are lesser, but I find it unlikely these aren't mostly dealer options.

Findings:

Assuming the 90% hedging, total shares to hedge options expiring on Friday is as follows: calls is around 15.85m shares. Total shares SHORT to hedge puts is around 525 thousand.  This means total shares or equivalents being held long by dealers/banks/mms to hedge right now JUST FOR FRIDAY (does not include longer dated options) is long 15.3m shares.

When Friday is ending, a few things happen:

1. If options are held to close, they get GME stock settled. Those won't affect price, assuming those who get the GME stock hold. But most people would not do that as option traders.
2. If you dump your massive tendie bearing options, you dump them to a dealer who in turn uses that call to neutralize their exposure, so they sell the delta exposure of your stock. If you sell a $20 call right now, a dealer is going to immediately dump 99.5 shares of GME stock.
3. OF course, if you do #2, then promptly buy new GME options, you offset some of this, but you won't offset most of it. A massively in the money call has a delta of 1, while a decently OOM call has a delta in the .1 to .3 range, which means net selling of 70 per contract , unless you buy a LOT more contracts, and options are getting more expensive. Of course, while a lot of us will roll to other GME calls, I'm sure some of you will take money out for taxes, or go buy other options on other things, or even take the put side of this trade.
4. And here's the kicker. Brokerages start forcing liquidations on these options as the close on friday approaches. If you would be out of margin compliance on the exercise of your massively appreciated options (by having a ton of GME stock and a huge negative cash balance after exercise), they'll simply force you to sell your options at the bid the MMs are offering. That then starts the cascade I just outlined in #2. You can then roll that into 3 if you want.

So, in summary, be really careful here. This could entirely moon even higher next week. And there's a ton of longer dated OI I did not analyze. But Friday and early Monday looks really scary in terms of dealer de-hedging, and the massive run we had these past few days looks like a gamma squeeze where these banks/dealers/mms had to accumulate shares to hedge all of their short options. Remember, thereƒ??s a huge gamma ramp in the 20s and low 30s that shot this up yesterday. That same ramp can shoot this stock down too. 

**This is one of the largest dealer unwinds we've seen in any stock, and really anything could happen. More importantly, there's not currently a lot of gamma ramp over this, in part because it was hard to buy options at higher strikes until basically today.**

Disclaimer: I did buy deep oom puts targeting NEXT week, and would make a ton of money if this came to pass. I put in about $100k in capital mostly in Jan 22 $28 puts.  This week makes more sense, but I'd get liquidated too by my broker if GME pukes Friday, so the trade won't work. I may very well swing hard long if the sell off is furious enough then ride this up again to $40 ???? ???? ????",Analysis of Massive Potential GME Forced Selling Friday (Up to 1/3 of total float),44210.46778,t3_kxb7dy,"Analysis of Massive Potential GME Forced Selling Friday (Up to 1/3 of total float) There was some action in another thread about this, but thought I'd summarize my math on possible dealer/MM forced selling friday. **At present, it appears that  as many as 15.3m shares of GME will get dumped between now and the close Friday, and GME has float of 46m shares.

15259,Buy,RKT,,FlyWannaBeRichGuy,lrzoey,159,197,"RKT - Earnings tomorrow and short interest is now at 41%!

Rocket mortgage reports earnings tomorrow after the bell. Rocket is currently the largest mortgage brokerage platform (Fintech) in the industry.  They currently have about 9% of the space and are projecting 25% within 5 years. 

Reports from the CEO teased that they are partnering with the largest financial institution. Rumor suggest Berkshire since they are the largest. Their partner ships with companies like Intuit have dramatically grown their revenues so I expect the ƒ??largest financial institutionƒ? to dramatically boost their forecasts. 

Nov 2020 their announced a 1 billion dollar buyback option that lasts 2 years.  Iƒ??m not sure they will need to execute the buyback but this shows the board of directors they are serious about killing off this short fund.  

Over the last 6 months this stock has been channel traded as hedge funds like BlackRock recently doubled their positions.  

It pattern trades 3-4 day spikes followed by 10-15 days declines with a solid support at $20. 

Today the short interest reported showed an increase to 41%.  With 5 days to cover.  This is insanely high.  

Let me preface Iƒ??m not advocating a squeeze im just simply giving my opinion on above news will cause. I believe RKT was attacked by the same short funds shorting all meme stocks as this was the darling back when it IPOƒ??d in here and got smacked down by shorts.  Back then short interest was at mid 20ƒ??s when it spiked to $35.  

The big complaint was that 10 year treasuries were rising and inflation will kill mortgage stocks.  Powell spoke today and said they would try to keep rates low around 2% for a long time. 

Todayƒ??s housing report showed a surprise of 4% new home purchases vs .9% projected.  This is a huge beat and only fuels suspicions that Rocket will have a massive quarter report. 

Rocket has the best refinance / return customer of any company.  They have a 70% refinance rate because they track their customers logging In to their account.  The industry avg is 23%.  

The one downside is the 8% economic interest the A shares have.  If rocket grows their projected 25% market share then their value is somewhere around $40-$60 in my opinion.  If they maintain 10% market share then they shouldnƒ??t be worth more than the $20 they have now.  Might be the reason a short hedge fund is piling on them to halt their growth.  Maybe a competitor.  Speculating so I digress. 

When looking at the chart.  Look at the strength at holding $20.  Is this a moon shot, probably not... However with the volatility happening in GME and AMC I believe any pressure put on RKT shorts will force them to cover while the market piles in because this is a damn good company being held down by a hedgie bastard.","Rocket Mortgage Earnings, Massive Partnership announcement and Buyback. 41% Short interest!",44251.95987,t3_lrzoey,"Rocket Mortgage Earnings, Massive Partnership announcement and Buyback. 41% Short interest!

If they maintain 10% market share then they shouldnƒ??t be worth more than the $20 they have now.  Might be the reason a short hedge fund is piling on them to halt their growth.  Maybe a competitor.  Speculating so I digress. 

When looking at the chart.  Look at the strength at holding $20.  Is this a moon shot, probably not...

**The open interest on GME 7/16 15p dropped from 54K to 6K last week.** They bought them in early October based on historical open interest / options volumes when the puts were over a $7/premium.

Even if they timed the exact bottom near $12, that's still around a **$25 million realized loss** from all the extrinsic value going to waste. The stock price started rallying up afterwards, so presumably they started covering their shorts too after unloading their puts?

&amp;#x200B;

 Firstly, the institutional shorts like BOfA and melvin have yet to cover, yet are getting pushed further underwater. When/If the squeeze eventually occurs, it is going to be violent. This also shows that the price dips at the 19 range was not a short attack but rather weak hands profit taking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, a big player is accumulating. Either itƒ??s Cohen trying to increase his stake for takeover(heƒ??ll have to report within 2 days), or another institution buying. Either way its bullish.

Before every console season, some idiots start shorting GME, resulting in a mini short squeeze in 2008 and  2014. At its peak, it had a share price of about $64. Now, take a look at how much higher the short interest is, and how much lower the float (total number of shares issued) is. Accounting for the same peak market cap, this gives a conservative estimate of $150 if the squeeze occurs. Note that due to the significantly higher short interest, it may very well exceed 150 by a mile.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, for the short squeeze to occur, we need to all stop being paperhanded bitches. stop fucking selling at a 20% gain when u can easily get a 10x gain. The more liquidity u give to shorters, the less violent the short squeeze.

The day after that, GME went as high as $37.25 and closed at $37.00. The day after that, it went up to $95 and closed above $86.  So GME went up ~450% in two days following the day it spiked to near 40 and dropped down to half that.

**Attention retards:** After Friday's short bloodbath I wanted to see if we'd made it through the squeeze for now and if all the low-hanging fruit had been shaken out. **Apparently not.** In fact, it's looking even harder for the shorts to borrow now.

Since [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) only updates once a day in the morning for GME, I went to IBKR to check to see if the data there was more current. Turns out that yes, it had updated as of 1/23 and lo and behold, our **power level is 9000.**

**????????????????????????????????????**

**GME|USD|GAMESTOP CORP-CLASS A|36285627|XXXXXXXW1099|-32.6198|32.6998|9000|**

32% interest to borrow rate, 9000 shares available according to IBKR. That's $585,000 worth of available stock to short at Friday's closing price - 0.0129% of its total market cap.

According to the chart at [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), this was down from 1,200,000 shares as recently as 1/18, one of only 4 times in the last 3 months that many shares had been available. The squeeze last week plowed right through that firewall. Now it's gone.

**Reading the chart:** ""Outlined below is a snapshot of the sample file output which includes the stock symbol, currency of denomination, name, contract identifiers (IBƒ??s and the ISIN), rebate &amp; fee rates and shares available.""

????????????????????????????????????

**What I think:** This is going to be a very long weekend for short sellers to think over whether they want to keep up their strategy. We could be looking at another monster squeeze in the next week if the momentum continues and the big boys start unloading their positions. The pressure cooker hasn't even been turned on yet - my thinking is that we're heading to the Oort Cloud.

**Disclaimer:** I \*assume\* most ITM calls that get exercised this week aren't going to be available to short following the weekend - although I could be wrong.

**Attention retards:** After Friday's short bloodbath I wanted to see if we'd made it through the squeeze for now and if all the low-hanging fruit had been shaken out. **Apparently not.** In fact, it's looking even harder for the shorts to borrow now.

Since [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) only updates once a day in the morning for GME, I went to IBKR to check to see if the data there was more current. Turns out that yes, it had updated as of 1/23 and lo and behold, our **power level is 9000.**

I was rolling around restless unable to sleep thinking about all my fucking gains and feeling bad I didn't tell all my friends and family about GME. Well here you fucking go because it is not too late, not by a long shot.

**1.THE SHORTS ARE FUCKED.** I know you know this but honestly the evidence to so obvious but it just so fucking hard to believe because the shorts are almost as retarded as us. ALMOST.

**Short Interest:** We have been collecting shorts faster than we are losing them. The fee to borrow the shares is now at 45% per year **meaning** shares are becoming very scarce (normal rates are 0.3%) and there are only 100,000 available short. An estimated **77.44 MILLION SHARES are still short.** While the daily volume of shares traded has has surged well beyond 70 million, most of the trading has not been short covering and lots of it has been shorting. 

**The Shorts are still in massively, shorts are currently deep underwater, holding each day costs them a ton, they will scrabble for the nearest exit as quick as they can ONCE it really gets going, DON'T GIVE THEM AN EASY EXIT. HOLD.**

2. **SHORTS ARE REALLY FUCKED.** 

**RYAN COHEN**. Our lord and Savior Ryan fucking Cohen. He took Chewy from nothing and now its worth **47 Billion** and he started from scratch. Oh but what about ""digital downloads and amazon and other retailers killing GME business"". Did your Pets go hungry before Cohen created CHEWY? NO. Did Cohen capture a huge chuck of the market share of well established businesses with innovative thinking and create a company that was focused on the customers and E-commerce. YES

3. **Fuck the** ??????¯

**E-Commerce**, say it with me E-Commerce, it's up 800% year-over-year, and the E-commerce genius, **RYAN COHEN,** just stepped in by buying 13% percent of the company. GME is not a dying company and we have't even got close to the fair market value. When the company wasn't posting profits and we had a board full of Boomers holding onto way too many poorly located retail stores I could see why people lined up to short this thing. But with **THREE BOARD SEATS** our soon to be CEO is going to pull off the most massive turnaround of any company we have ever seen. He said **GAMESTOP will be the Amazon of Games and MORE.** And games is big big fucking business, 44 Billion in the US and 165 Billion globally last year and growing fast. 

4. **GME to the MOON** ????????????and staying there ????

**Cohen** is going to gut the unprofitable stores (we all know there were way too many in dying malls) and make the remaining stores the hub for all things even remotely gaming or high end consumer electronic related. The stores he does keep will be the thousands of wonderful little warehouses delivering your **NEW and USED** games, consoles, phones, drones, monitors, high end PC parts, and so much more. Not to mention the fact that gamestop will almost certainly start selling **used digital games.** If your buy your digital copy at gamestop they will let you sell it back to them so you can make a few bucks and they can make a lot more. Win Win. Oh and how about some store credit to keep Gamestop customers loyal. This will come to pass and it will be hugely profitable for Gamestop and rip the ??????¯thesis to fucking shreds. 

5. **Market Cap Expectations are all that Matter**????????

We all know that **expectations** front run real winners by a huge amount. Many of you have been feasting on Tesla and EV stock tendies for a while now. Tesla is now worth more than the largest nine car companies combined while only selling a tiny fraction of the cars. WHY???  Because it is lead by a visionary who can deliver. He will deliver and so will Cohen. Ryan Cohen will be a household name soon. **Gamestop is not stopping at $100** because that would put its market cap at **6.96 Billion.** I think **25 Billion or $360 a share** is fair value. 

**I am not SELLING!**

**TLDR part 2: Buy more shares because Gamestop is still extremely undervalued and you should expect price to go to at least 100 but very likely way higher on fundamental expectations alone. Add in the short squeeze and we will be in Valhalla soon if YOU DO YOUR PART AND FUCKING HOLD!**  **The shorts can't exit unless we let them. We are an army and we are in this together.**

Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well.

If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 98.4% ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.

Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.

Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.

If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.

3442,Buy,PLTR,,geomanis,l07ly5,168,415,"Hello fellow bagholders,

I am a palantir autist, aka, i've actually used foundry for 2-3 years at old workplace. I thought I'd write a piece to explain technically what it does, so you can feel more comfortable holding the bags and continue your confirmation bias.

# What is Foundry?

Foundry aggregates data from disparate systems and then allows non-technical users to combine, correlate, and chart it in many different ways. Here are how it works:

# Connect Data-Sources or upload data

Palantir uses a combination of Cassandra (for writing data quickly) and Parquet (for doing ad-hoc analysis) and SparkQL which helps do distributed data computing. I am not a data nerd, I don't understand this well, but it's much better than trying to do it yourself and getting eaten by Apache Alligators.

Enterprise users give authentication string to the Palantards, and they do either a pull or push from that data-store into Cassandra, which then writes it all over the place. Data analysis is done w/ Map-Reduce and Parquet tables to be ZOOOOOM.

I've seen people connecting p. much anything, whether it's Structued Query Language, Mongo, Comma-separated Value files (Automod didn't like the abbreviation), logs, excel spreadsheets, images, html, whatever. Can't say that it's a good idea connecting a bunch of these, but whatever we don't choose what garbage our employers like having their numbers and words in.

Anyway, data goes *PSSHHH* into Cassandra, Parquet goes *BRRR* and do SPEEDY data thing.

# Cleaning data using Blacksmith or code (Python or Apache Spark)

Okay, data is in AWS Parquet stores, but generally it sucks dick. Few examples of why it sucks:

* Country Code: US, USA, America, United States, US of A, MURIKA
* Name: Ree Tard, ReeTard, Ree, ree, Mr Ree Tard, Lord Ree\`Tard
* Date: 01/10/2021, 10th October 2021, 01/10/2021 (European though!)

So on, what this means is your data is super shit quality on ingestion. So you gotta write some code to look through all that data and make it Pristine *TM*. Nobody wants to make a chart seeing where all the retards who buy PLTR are from, and find that there are 40 variations of USA.

So you can do this with code, or something called Blacksmith. Blacksmith literally drag and drop simple web-ui click click delete garbage data, remove empty rows, format everything, replace dumb strings, etc.

Code gotta write stuff like.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img g4dubmm6m6c61...*

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like ""Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks"". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your ""I have all data in one view"" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click &gt; INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

GME buys over Super League or hires Ann ( based on a post about Ryan Cohen's tweet )

Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.50, with a median of 16.41.

Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 1.09. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.58.

Yesterday you were happy. Very happy. For the first time in a long time. Finally, your predictions of doom and gloom had come to fruition. You had dreamed of the apocalypse: where your AMC $5 puts would print and your outrage at the valuation for TSLA would be justified. Yesterday signaled the beginning of a beautiful future. A future in which droves of retards would crash and burn, millions would go unemployed, dollar would become worthless and mohawked gangs would roam the earth while you and you alone could gloat while posting your gain porn on WSB. This is you from yesterday:

I come here with a confession... 

I uhhhh, you see, the thing is, well... I NEVER CARED for this GME fetish you retards had going on here. 

Yep. Nada. Zippo. Zilch. 

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, ƒ??MoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEeeƒ? ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I donƒ??t think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say ƒ??Good men stood here, good men fought, and died on this groundƒ? as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combatƒ??Lions and Hyenas. 

These Lionsƒ??these Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, thereƒ??s usƒ??the lowly Hyenasƒ??retailƒ??the working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? Weƒ??re ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US ƒ??DUMBƒ? MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them ƒ??Like, how do you have so much moneyyy?ƒ? 

You know what they say? 

They reply: ƒ??Haha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, moneyƒ?





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) Heƒ??s called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) Heƒ??s congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) Heƒ??s congratulated WSB on the ƒ??short squeezeƒ? (implying that little thing, was itƒ??hoping weƒ??ll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when theyƒ??re cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. Theyƒ??re all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didnƒ??t believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. Iƒ??ve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

Iƒ??m throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till Iƒ??m fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ainƒ??t so dumb anymore...

Hey fellow traders. Today, lƒ??ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. Itƒ??s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and itƒ??s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I donƒ??t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoffƒ??s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior dayƒ??s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowskiƒ??s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next dayƒ??s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Fridayƒ??s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoffƒ??s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a foolƒ??s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock.

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

Iƒ??ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

Iƒ??m here to help. You bought 3 calls at $10 and you paid a premium for that. Well, someone had to sell you those options and they collected that premium from you. Itƒ??s cash in their bank and they can do anything they want with it.

You own at least 900 shares of AMC, well that means you can sell 9 covered calls to suckers on this sub. You might sell an option with a $10 strike price that will expire 3/12 and each option might be worth $50 in premium, I donƒ??t know. So 9\*50=$450 dollars. Way to go. Go invest that money.

But mac1222, what happens if the price of the stock hits or goes above $10? Well, [u/isellgoodqualitygood](https://www.reddit.com/u/isellgoodqualitygood/), then your 900 shares will be ƒ??calledƒ? away and youƒ??ll be paid $10 a share for each stock. Thatƒ??s 9000 dollars. Donƒ??t forget about the $450 you made!

What if the stock goes to $20 before the options expire. Well, mr good, youƒ??ve lost out on a lot of potential profit. If you kept the stock, you would have made $18,000. But let me say it again....loss of potential profit. You never lost any of your original investment.

What if the stock does not hit $10? Well then, the options expire worthless and you keep the premium.

What if I want out of my contracts before expiration? Easy. Remember, when selling an option, you are ƒ??selling to openƒ?. You will show ƒ??-9ƒ? because you are short. To get out of this agreement, you will have to ƒ??buy to closeƒ? those 9 contracts. Now you will have to pay the premium to buy them back. Poof....the transaction is over

Additionally, you will not be able to sell your 900 shares while you are under a contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, Iƒ??d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.

While a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.

Looks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Letƒ??s do this draw now. Itƒ??s American Thanksgiving after all.

\--

But before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didnƒ??t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.

**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote ƒ??meme stockƒ? shut the hell up?**

Just because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesnƒ??t mean Google and Apple are ƒ??meme companiesƒ?? No.

Unlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.

This rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**

Myself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.

This stock isnƒ??t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.

There is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.

PLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didnƒ??t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantirƒ??s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandoraƒ??s box of a company - the market is going ƒ??holy shitƒ?.

The only question mark that was in Palantirƒ??s path was the impact Joe Bidenƒ??s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.

With a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.

Thatƒ??s why we are up bigly this week.

But more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**

1. In the 90ƒ??s PCƒ??s took over. 
2. In the 2000ƒ??s it was all about the .coms.
3. The 2010ƒ??s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.
4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.

And because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. 

Once the entire world and everything in your home goes ƒ??smartƒ? and becomes connected to Starlinkƒ??s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**

At the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.

For those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing ""ethical"" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?

This has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. 

Common sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. 

Google's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. 

When it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.

So again, this is not a fucking ""meme stock"".

PLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.

So: 

* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)
* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)
* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We arenƒ??t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)
* Stop viewing Palantir like itƒ??s a penny stock. Itƒ??s not.

**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.

How you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sellƒ??

There are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.

In 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.

God speed.

First, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.

I've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.

As much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.

Depending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.

**Options Explained**

***The Basics***

Buying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).

* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.  
* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.

Selling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.

* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.
* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

***The Money***

For Calls:

* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.

For Puts:

* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current strike price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

***Calls Explained***

Buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)

This is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.

* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even
* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent
* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars
* Price - Price of the option

In the above example:

* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.

The Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.

***Buying Naked Calls***

Ok, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.
* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**
* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.

***Selling Naked Calls***

If you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)

Notice ""To Break Even"" turns into ""Chance of Profit.""  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.

**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.

***Puts Explained***

Buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.

[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)

None of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.

* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised

***Buying Naked Puts***

The 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.
* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.
* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.

***Selling Naked Puts***

If you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.

**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS ""CAPPED"" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**

***Options Pricing***

The price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.

* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|
   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value
   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price. 
   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play
* Extrinsic Value
   * Effected by theta and implied volatility
   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
   * Theta
      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.
      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE

https://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d

* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV. 
   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.
   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.
   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.

***The Details***

Going back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774

This explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.

* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree
* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold
* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day
* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled

Bid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.

Open Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.

The lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.

***The Greeks***

You can see the Greeks listed above for this call.

* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.
* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.
* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.
* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.
* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.

First, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.

I've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.

As much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.

Depending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.

**Options Explained**

***The Basics***

Buying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).

* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.  
* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.

Selling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.

* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.
* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

***The Money***

For Calls:

* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.

For Puts:

* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current strike price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

***Calls Explained***

Buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)

This is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.

* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even
* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent
* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars
* Price - Price of the option

In the above example:

* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.

The Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.

***Buying Naked Calls***

Ok, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.
* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**
* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.

***Selling Naked Calls***

If you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)

Notice ""To Break Even"" turns into ""Chance of Profit.""  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.

**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.

***Puts Explained***

Buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.

[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)

None of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.

* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised

***Buying Naked Puts***

The 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.
* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.
* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.

***Selling Naked Puts***

If you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.

**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS ""CAPPED"" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**

***Options Pricing***

The price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.

* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|
   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value
   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price. 
   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play
* Extrinsic Value
   * Effected by theta and implied volatility
   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
   * Theta
      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.
      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE

https://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d

* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV. 
   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.
   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.
   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.

***The Details***

Going back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774

This explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.

* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree
* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold
* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day
* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled

Bid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.

Open Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.

The lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.

***The Greeks***

You can see the Greeks listed above for this call.

* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.
* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.
* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.
* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.
* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.

This vehicle-based payment solution will create new opportunities for automakers to offer a vast array of payment services and develop previously untapped revenue streams. The solution will create a ""digital fingerprint"" for the vehicle, allowing it to securely connect to a bank's payment network, validate, and autonomously pay for a wide range of frequently used services, including fuel, tolls, parking, insurance, maintenance, and other ""wallet"" capabilities. Historically, vehicle-based payment processes have been complex and leverage legacy banking primitives such as physical credit cards or multiple smartphone apps to communicate with each individual merchant and service provider.

This is a massive step and hopefully the first of a number of key pieces of news that could be used as potential catalysts for BB over the coming days. CEO John Chen is addressing investors as apart of JP Morgan Investor conference today. Typically Chen does not stand in for these meetings so the fact that hes coming out now to lead the show is a very bullish sign. There is still a long way to go, but this is the turning point now with another investor meeting with Cannacord tomorrow.

My sense is that GME was being massively shorted despite it being relatively healthy on the books because it's obviously doomed. They've had years to move into a new field and constantly failed. Look at Kongregate, they bought that and for years idled with it. Look at Miniclip vs Kongregate. 

And what I wanted to ask you clowns is what would actually fix GME? My thoughts:

My drug induced best guess is Gamestop will become Redbox. In dummy words: Gamestop will shut down physical large stores and sell games from vending machines due to increased digital sales. Gamestop used to be the place dad would go to have some smart nerd tell him which game to buy the kid so dad can see his mistress Yulia more often. Now it's literally just a smelly box with games.

So why don't they buy Redbox or another company that has logistics and tech to distribute games everywhere. There's only a handful of MUST HAVE games in any given quarter. This is a no brainer. Where is my mistake? Not enough coke?

Here is a diagram of roles showing how money exchange hands. These are just roles, some companies act as multiple roles.

                        +-------&gt;    DTC     &lt;---------+                       |                              |                   buybroker -&gt; clearing company &lt;=[3 days]=&gt; clearing company -&gt; sellbroker  

When we buy or sell, money don't exchange hands immediately. They go via clearing process, where roughly speaking they just record all transactions, then settle the balance with each other **every 3 days** with a single balancing payment. It is important to understand, that balancing payment is much less than total volume of trade between clearing companies, because on average everyone trades with everyone. For this particular trade 3 day delay means, that sellers clearing company is on the hook: they already paid seller, but real money for this deal will come later.

What if buyers clearing company goes down? Nobody likes to be exposed, so the mechanism of collateral was invented. All clearing companies deposit cash in custodian (DTC) to guarantee that if counterparty goes bankrupt, they are not at loss or at least exposure is calculated upfront and accounted for. It's logical that collateral is calculated in proportion to the expected balancing payment.

When WSB started trading, all expectations were off, all risk models were out of the window. There was a risk that Melvin Capital wont be able to pay for the stocks they are buying or more precisely wont be able to clear 3 days down the line when settlement is due, this in turn would bankrupt other clearing companies on the market, causing cascading effect.

So custodian (DTC), being in a risk management business, decided that GME stocks causes to much risk and demanded 100% collateral . What does it mean in practice? Now suddenly clearing companies need to deposit 100% of **whole GME volume** they are trading, which is much more than what they could afford immediately. They had no option other than to refuse to clear GME trades, which in turned caused RH, WeBull &amp; others to shut buys.

Why European companies continue to trade? I don't know. Maybe their clearing process is much faster (minutes? hours?) and their exposure is much less as a result, so collateral requirements are significantly lower.

**Facebook Patent Settlement/Deal/Partnership Catalyst** 

Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement. Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more.

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram.

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares. 

**IVY Connected Car + Amazon Partnership**

As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY. *Following is a deep dive into that partnership* in anticipation of the AWS and IVY webinar on Feb 23rd 2PM EST.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.
* The developers wonƒ??t need specialized or automotive software skills.

BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy ƒ??By the way this project, weƒ??ve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years..we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..ƒ?.

He goes on to say that this creates a recuring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckensey&amp;Co report outlined (see my summary) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the ƒ??plumbingƒ? or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)

**Facebook Patent Settlement/Deal/Partnership Catalyst** 

Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement. Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more.

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram.

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares. 

**IVY Connected Car + Amazon Partnership**

As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY. *Following is a deep dive into that partnership* in anticipation of the AWS and IVY webinar on Feb 23rd 2PM EST.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.
* The developers wonƒ??t need specialized or automotive software skills.

Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data.

I know autists and retards are ???s and blindly chasing ???s, but hear me out here. If we really want GME to moon, we need boomer money to be convinced that GameStop is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. How do we do that is by making the case to the institutional money that GameStop is legit. It's obvious to us because people our age actually enjoy spending time, money, and effort on video games. And guess what? For Gen Z people, video games are a lifestyle. As more young people matriculate into the workforce, the growth for the industry only looks bright.

Now I'll sneak in a ??????¯ argument here. We know that the future of video games is likely going to be Sass (think DLC, Skins, and Subscriptions) so there may not be much of a space for a middlemen like GME. But, from what I understand GameStop already has a somewhat sizable customer base. As all profitable e-commerce companies do, it is not about selling the product to the people, it is about selling the people to the product - we'll see how they do. Honestly, from what I can tell their in prime position to make this work.

&amp;#x200B;

But back to the point, if we really want to make a buck here, we have to convince boomer money that this is good idea. Let's be real here, only they have the capital to drive the price up significantly. If they do before the shorts are closed... well sorry Melvin, you made a bad trade. ????????????????????????????????????

So here's the real money making strategy - convince boomers that GME is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. Boomer money likely got screwed on those companies before so we need to make the case that GME isn't that and it's in fact a really good investment.

TLDR: ??????? + ???????ø = ????????????????????????????

8998,Sell,GME,,13104598210,l6n4ay,1584,16757,"Greetings all. Bit of background: I've been on this sub for years (was even a mod temporarily when /u/only1parkjisung modded a bunch of people for fun long, long ago), and I've been in the hedge fund world for about a decade (I'm a sell-side analyst; won't go into more detail than that as it isn't necessary). I mention all of this because I know both how this world works and how the hedge fund world works, which gives me a unique insight into what might happen next.

I won't make any predictions on GME, BB, or other stocks, because I don't think the squeeze's biggest risk right now is there. Rather, the biggest risk comes from what we've already seen happen over at Discord with the shutdown of the server. Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. At least one of these firms has invested with Point72 Ventures, which recently helped Melvin Capital. So it's not too surprising that strings were pulled to get the Discord channel banned for ""hate speech"" (which is a very useful brush to tar anyone with, as anyone who challenges it can easily be dismissed as a nazi).

Now, this subreddit's long history of using several slurs is an opportunity for the hedge fund world to claim it is a hate subreddit and pressure Reddit to get it closed. I recommend the r-word and f-word be banned by mods for this reason; yes I know it is stupid and, well, r-worded, but best to play the game and self censor rather than give these assholes a single in to destroy this community.

What is the risk of Reddit getting orders from owners to shut us down? At the moment, I'd say pretty low, but the bigger it gets the more there is that risk. Reddit is owned by Advance Publications, which is owned by Donald Newhouse and the Newhouse family (some details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Newhouse). Fortunately, Newhouse's family office (think a private hedge fund dedicated to investing just the family's money) is pretty far removed from the hedge fund world afaik. The family office's CIO (details here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1g6j2tztzpb3t/A-New-CIO-for-One-of-America-s-Richest-Families) got her career started in the investment bank world and did not work for hedge funds, at least according to her Linkedin profile. So the Donaldson family has limited motive to stick their necks out and force a ban of this subreddit.

However, it remains a risk and a very serious one. I suggest the mods work together to get some legal representation going; if Palihapitiya was serious about investing in the WSB community, I'd suggest putting some money aside for this and for compliance. A kickstarter fund would not be a good idea because of the ease with which bad faith arguments of collusion could be made.

In short, WSB is at the mercy of Reddit's admins, who are at the mercy of its executives, who are at the mercy of the owners. While WSB is making serious progress as a revolution against the billionaires, this is a very serious weakness that the Discord ban has exposed and that mods need to work on fixing asap.",The biggest risk we face (and why it's nothing to worry about for now),44223.86404,t3_l6n4ay,"The biggest risk we face (and why it's nothing to worry about for now) Greetings all.

I'll make it easy and copy the relevant part for you.

1. There should be an existing downtrend in place before the pattern occurs.
2. The three lows should be roughly equal in price and spaced out from each other. While the price doesn't have to be exactly equal, it should be reasonably close to the same price, such that a trendline is horizontal.
3. The volume should drop throughout the pattern in a sign that bears are losing strength, while bullish volume should increase as the price breaks through the final resistance.

&gt;At the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. data analytics company Palantir Technologies was tapped by over a dozen governments around the world including the U.S. government to use its software to manage the data about the spread of COVID-19, analyze trends and anticipate various needs across the supply chain. Alexander Karp is CEO and one of several co-founders of Palantir. On Thursday, Jan. 7 at 10:00 a.m. ET, Karp will join Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to talk about the challenges faced by governments around the world in relying on technology and software to respond to the pandemic.

**Feb/March**:

Palantir expected to report 2020 full year earnings. Will top $1B in revenue. Possible surprise profit. If the Q3 earnings report is a guide, expect lots of client success stories and Covid-19 mixed in with financial results.

**New Government contract announcements**:

Palantir is helping State and International Governments manage their Covid-19 response. This includes outbreak detection, medical supplies production, hospital capacity, PPE distribution, vaccine development and distribution, contract tracing, and more.

This often represents the first time those Governments have seen Palantir in action. Having now experienced the speed and capabilities of Palantir's software, these Governments will likely seek additional Palantir partnerships. This real-world, global demo represents exponential contract growth potential.

**Even more new Government contract announcements**:

SolarWinds hack + ""cyber security agenda"" of incoming US Government = Palantir opportunity. Palantir has intrusion detection, monitoring, and best practices products ready to deploy. Palantir's Cyber solution can be added on top of competitor products for layered security.

Without further ado, letƒ??s get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMCƒ??s price action after the breakout. \[Juicy is what juicy does\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\_looking\_juicy\_next\_resistance\_targets\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.

As you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, itƒ??s fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. 

So far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.

Another thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.

And the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).

Overall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?

Love you and fuck you with all of my heart,

Roman, aka TA degenerate.

Oh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:

So far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.

Another thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.

And the last but not least, take a look at this fascinating momentum visualisation: True Strength Indicator. AMC looks a bit exhausted, while GME has a lot of potential unrealised upside steam under the hood (fat magenta rectangle).

Overall, the TA picture for GME looks nice and juicy to me, what do you think?

Love you and fuck you with all of my heart,

Roman, aka TA degenerate.

Oh, and this is a closeup of the price action after the breakout. *Thinking of a spot on metaphor...* The things look as similar as my left and right testicle:

Very strong pre-market activity opening with a 2.5M shares sold to force price below 95.  [Read this post to understand why this 95 level matters. Absolutely on point during today's action.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4207e/gme_options_pricing_expected_and_max_volatility/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) MM needed to defend this price level or hedge above it. At this point in time, for 1/29, there were 25.000 puts ITM and +25.000 calls OTM between 95 - 115. Once the 95 level broke, it was a gamma event like last friday only this time, price shoot-up above the highest strike and all the way to $160. Notice the deceleration after 115 (highest strike) which could mean that MM were completing their hedges. After, I believe we started seeing short covering and margin calls. 22M shares traded hands within 20 minutes as price shoots from 115 to 160 and with $10 dollar bid-ask spreads.   


But then, trading halted and SPY took a violent dive bringing down all equities across the board. Algo trading kicked-in and GME lost 50% in less than 30min. However, unlike the previous increase, less than 10M shares traded hands in that period. Notice how OBV reacted with both moves.

The MM gamma event lost momentum and at exactly noon, when liquidity tends to dry, a big short attack to drive price down to the previous open, only to be countered by some big money purchases to where it currently stands (and likely will close).

&amp;#x200B;

My take on all this is that the tape is showing accumulation at current prices. OI in OTM calls and puts is now close to 200.000 contracts (say actually 15M shares - or half the current float to hedge) for 1/29 alone. Gamma events are not over and if today is any indication, it seems like MMs are more active hedging then last week. With a gap-up at open it should be similar price action.

So first off, I've been in this trade since Friday, and my fault for not at least posting before this morning, I meant to finish writing this last night. But it's a longer term strategy and one day should not derail the overall goal. 

So here's the deal. I've been waiting on this trade almost all of this year.  I rarely trade TSLA or popular meme stocks in general. But there's a trade setting up that is similar to the rolling QQQ trade from 2020. First I want to say this trade only sees it's true potential when there's a prolonged move for an asset in either direction at almost a straight line, which is very rare in equities. 

Taking a step back, another requirement for this trade to come to fruition is that the general bull market in equities continues higher from this point. Length and magnitude don't have to be too large, but another couple months, and another 250 S&amp;P points or so is required.  

With the backdrop of a continuing bull market, by which the case can be made for many reasons I won't go into here, and what I'm about to lay out, now is the time to enter an 8-10 week trade, using a **specific rolling weekly strategy on TSLA,** beginning this morning.

In parabolic bull markets, and specifically in individual names and leaders of those bull markets, proportional growth ratios become a big part of the price action leading into the acceleration phases. One can argue that TSLA itself is the clear leader of this particular bull market, the original meme stock flag-bearer, arguably sharing the title with the likes of AMD.

Taking an outside look at the growth patterns of TSLA's stock during this historic bull run, TSLA shows the most defined fractal pattern, indicating constant proportional growth near the ratio of the golden mean.. than any other leaders. And that makes sense given that it represents this bull market as a whole. Attached are some representations of this growth rate and it's respective pattern. It doesn't need to be complicated.

Given this rare setup, I think the rally to 900 will be almost linear and weekly call options beginning with 8/6 will return over 1000%. At which point **1/3 of total proceeds will be rolled into 8/13 before close Friday.**  This strategy will allow for the errant negative week to occur, or even two in a row.  The expected return on this trade by October end is in the order of 200x original trade size.  It sounds crazy.  I'll explain it more in a bit.



Given the set up has reached maturity, and with the assumption that the S&amp;P continues it's bull run over the next 8-10 weeks, and given whom I consider it's sister company leading this bull market, AMD, already made it's own linear run through all time highs.. as well as others like SQ approaching new highs today on acquisition news or NVDA's recent run to substantial new highs. I'm making the assumption that TSLA will continue it's bull run after a 6 month consolidation, and make new highs which by definition are above 900. 

I think the new rally will peak at about $1350. These are all signs &amp; indications of a blow-off top phase of a general bull market that could last any range of timeframes, but as we've seen some of the most amazing moves in equities can happen during these times, and this trade hones in on one specific move that will be looked at in the context of a bigger picture when it's all said and done. The time and opportunity to make a trade like this is now.  More perfect would have been this morning. But if the thesis is right, the move will be nearly linear and there won't be many opportunities for a pullback.

I'm gonna keep it short and simple for you. What do we like? Squeezes. While some of us are still waiting for the mother of all short squeezes, another type of squeeze is setting itself up in $CLOV.

For those of you who are not in the know, $CLOV is a disruptor in the Health Insurance industry.   
 They use Artificial Intelligence to leverage the Big Data that can only be acquired as a health insurer to help offer the best medicare plans for seniors &amp; combine that with better care thanks to their Clover Assistant app designed for doctors that combines patient history for AI based clinical recommendations that end up reducing costs &amp; liabilities for their overall model.  

""The tech-enabled health insurer differentiates itself from incumbents by collecting and analyzing health and behavioral data to lower costs and improve medical outcomes for its members. Itƒ??s part of a new cohort of heavily funded insurtech startups"".

What gives them an edge over the others in this space like OSCR, WELL, UNH, HUM, etc. are the people on board &amp; invested - The President Andrew Toy is a former Google Engineer + Google itself has backed and partnered with Clover Health.  Thats a great silicon valley backing, but what else?  Well they have powerful political connections as well...  Chelsea Clinton is a big investor and is on the board of directors.  They also have the former head of Medicare on the board of directors...  these are powerful and important people for a new 'insurence tech' startup like clover.

But the fact that this stock is great long term hold and has its PT set between 15.00 and 19.00 (a great and easy 2x upside from today's price) by the end of the year is besides the point of this post, we also know that certain insiders like the CEO (who owns over 80m shares) cannot even sell their shares until the price has been 30$ for 90 consecutive days...  hmm.  . but ..  We want tendies, and we want them now. 

As you all know by now, gamma squeezes are triggered as option sellers are forced to buy the underlying when there is a good chance that the options they sold will be ITM at expiry. Here is the current open interest (contracts for which the sellers would have to buy shares as the price action approaches the strike) for the May 21 expiry :

Anybody else see a nice lift-off ramp? I sure do.

Now also take this into account.  They announced last week that they will announce earnings on 5/17 - this is about 1 month SOONER than originally planned.  They also chose to do the earnings on a MONDAY pre-market...  note how recently, rocket companies did theirs on a THURSDAY after hours...  a company does this only if they have good news.  And interestingly 5/17 is the week of OpEx (options expiration for the whole market) this is the monday of the week this entire option chain expires .. this usually signifies that volatility will up there.  Any good numbers or Good Guidance reported that day 5/17 could cause a gamma squeeze if the price shoots over 14$

As an added cherry on top, the stock has been severely suppressed by short sellers in the 2 months and SI is hovering over 40% now, and shorts may have to cover if any type of volume &amp; momentum come into play here since retail and insiders now own more than half the float.

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

11324,Hold,GME,,Vikbotik,l8w14o,47,185,"2020 killed part of my dreams, I'm a musician that gave up everything to buy his basic home studio equipement and go live in foreign country where  touring was going to be easier to do so. Financed myself cleaning hotel and airbnb rooms, toilets, laundry, everything. At 4am I woke up every day to write and perfect, my third record, the best album I've done in my life. Recorded it myself. But without the possibility to tour and no way of getting the money to make physical copies anymore I just decided to release it 7 months after finishing it literally for free on Bandcamp and the usual platforms. Had to let it go cus I had to move on, even thought of stopping music forever since nothing is going to open in Europe soon. I had a good reception online, got some nice recognition in my home country but no real monies. I wanted to share it live so badly, I still do. The lockdown and lack of possibilities to plan for the future I fell into a weird depressive loop of waking up late and just working out with some used weights I bought since the gyms closed. Life began going dim.

Fast forward three months later. One day, talking to a friend about stocks (him getting me interested into knowing more about it) when I saw GME went up to 90$, I laughed with Joy. How the fuck ? Everything is closed! I was happy to see that, I loved going there as a kid when my mom took me to the USA and just seeing the games cus we couldn't buy em but I loved everything about them cus thanks to YouTube I could follow new games, trends and MLG back in the Halo 2 days. Loved that shit to death. I once went to a tournament and almost won without having a console, just because of what I had seen online.

Anyways, saw the stock, chuckled and moved on. Then I saw what was happening around 3 days ago. I was excited, I was moved. I found WSBs and read all of you guys stories and I realized I wasn't alone. We're all in this together. We've all suffered loss and desilusion last year and we needed something to be joyful about. This is it. It's a true revolution as well. A spiritual and economic one at the same time. That's why I spent all the money I had except for a few bucks to last a week of food. Holding 67 AMC and 11 GME. Not much, but it's honest Meme Stonk. 

I saw the dip go way down the last few days, red red red but also green at times and I haven't sold even with this being all I have atm. And not gonna lie, I've had trouble sleeping from the excitement. This has brung me back the ability to hope and dream and look forward to the future.
I dream of the possibility to buy a place big enough to help my family out that's stuck in a country where the daily murder rate is 14 people and gettem out of there. I dream of just having a place to call my own, do my music for my own personal growth and doing my weights workouts. All of this, alongside the family I'll raise. Might be simple, but that's what I've come to value the most now a days (26yo).

But enough emotional stuff. 
Why this story? Cus I felt like sharing with my retarded family at WSB. NEVER LOSE THE ABILITY TO DREAM AND HOPE. YOUR PRESENT AND SPECIALLY YOUR FUTURE DEPEND ON IT.

Listen up retards,

I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.

BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.

They ƒ??wonƒ? the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.

Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)

While I donƒ??t think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think itƒ??s a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday

But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.

Not financial advice.

Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)

The fact that over 100% of available shares have been shorted, means once the squeeze begins the **price will LITERALLY reach infinite** because anything above the 100% of shorted stock does **not exist**. This situation would cause a massive, disgusting financial crisis where everybody (except GME longs) would lose money. The banks, the clearing houses, the brokerages, any investors that have money in the market. 

A financial crisis happening amidst a financial crisis would be absolutely catastrophic for the US Economy. Every thing the feds have done to prop up our economy from the March crash would be reverted, **we'd be back to all time lows in no time**.

# Lawsuits

Citadel and other clearing firms would be sued out of their tight, bright pink assholes. There would be demand for \~10% more stock than exists. Customers are contractually obliged to receive this stock, if clearing firms are unable to give their clients their legally obligated shares, Citadel can be the target of lawsuits (amongst every other clearing firm in existence and brokerages). 

There is SO many more people than just Melvin that would be absolutely raw fucked by a short squeeze of over 100% of shorted stock. This gives **all** the big players massive motivation to commit felonies to prevent a 100%+ squeeze, hell even the government wouldn't give a fuck. They are trying to save our economy at this point.

# January 28th Gamma Squeeze and why it's so important

Shares were being bought up by investors like mad, and by Market Makers who were hedging against the rising prices. This in turn, caused even higher prices sparking a positive feedback loop up to $450+.

If the stock price went any higher, shorts would be forced to begin covering which would have begun the Short Squeeze to infinite. This would have demolished our countries economy and sent us back to the stone age as all shorts began liquidating all their positions, causing a positive feedback loop of selling.

This is why clearing houses forced their brokerages to ban the purchase of stock. We were ready for takeoff to destroy the US economy and become millionaires. This is exactly what everyone on Wall Street wants to prevent.

# WhAt abOuT RoBinHoOd ManIpUlAtiOn

I honestly feel (a tiny bit) bad for the guys. They couldn't give a fuck less about the price of GME. They were caught in the crosshairs like everyone else. They took the wrong route by saying they ""are protecting customers"" when in reality Citadel twisted their arm to shut off trading for the good of the economy. And surely, Citadel has top government officials twisting their arm to prevent a crash. Not saying not to leave RH, but it really was NOT their decision and they had no choice, they did not act individually (though it did benefit them). I will 100% being GTFO'ing robinhood.

I.E Tastyworks/Webull had no choice but to stop the purchase of meme stocks for a temporary amount of time while their clearing house Apex forced them to.  But at least tastyworks/webull were honest.

# So will there be a squeeze?

**HELL FUCKING YES THERE WILL!** Look, everyone on Wall Street is absolutely fucked if they cannot lower the shorted shares below 100%. This is why we saw increased margin requirements, brokerages forcing us to sell stock, banning the purchase of new stock, fake news articles telling you the shorts already covered, fake accounts trying to get you to sell some gme and go to other meme stocks/ dog coins. They severely need that number below 100%, but do not care if you fully liquidate your GME position, just some.

Everyone on Wall Street stands to lose monumental amounts of money if they cannot get that number below 100%. This caused everyone to collude and decide to implement those crazy restrictions we saw on the 28th, but still allowed shorts to cover (which they did -- only a very small amount but still).

Again think to the **VW squeeze, why wasn't there massive market manipulation to prevent that one?** Probably because short float wasn't 100%+ and no one gave a fuck about the funds going bankrupt off it because it didn't affect them, in GME's case, it affects everyone.

The squeeze is inevitable and will occur. They just don't want a squeeze that destroys the US economy, and are working hard to lower the intensity of the squeeze so that it solely destroys the shorts (who will still get a bailout by the banks). 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** The squeeze is STILL COMING! Once the clearing houses, brokerages, US economy is out of the crosshairs of the squeeze, they will leave the shorts to die and bleed. They do not give two fucks about Melvin or anyone else who shorted, at this point they just want to save themselves and make the squeeze less intense.

**TL;DR2:** They didn't close trading because they want to just keep banning the short squeeze, just long enough for it to be less intense.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that over 100% of available shares have been shorted, means once the squeeze begins the **price will LITERALLY reach infinite** because anything above the 100% of shorted stock does **not exist**. This situation would cause a massive, disgusting financial crisis where everybody (except GME longs) would lose money.

Listen.

Fidelity and Vanguard are in a class of their own when it comes to retail brokers available to retail investors. Shithood, Interactive Dumbasses and so on do NOT compare. 

Shithood is a little startup that has to answer to hedge funds, HFTs (their main customers of order flow buys), and venture capitalists. Shithood CEO has no fucking idea what he's doing and is clearly vested in our failure.

## **Fidelity and Vanguard** ????????ƒ??

Here come the big fucking boys!

Fidelity has **$3.3 trillion**, YES trillion, in assets under management. Vanguard has **$8.8 trillion** in assets under management. I am saying TRILLIONS, not little billions.

Guess what? **THEY ANSWER TO NO FUCKING ONE**.

## **Fidelity owns 13.67% of GME shares.** ????????????

And Vanguard? 6.27% of GME shares.

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

4281,Sell,TSLA,,ALITTLEBITLOUDER,iplfl3,235,550,"I finally did it. I took today's bounce on TSLA as an opportunity to cut my losses get the hell off this rollercoaster. Over the last month, I managed to gain about 120k from TSLA alone, and then promptly lost 153k in the last week. Big oof. 

Hindsight being 20/20, it's easy to see what I SHOULD have done. I knew, or at least expected TSLA to fall, but what I did not expect was the absolutely crushing blow that was dealt. 

The beginning of the decline started off as me selling bull put spreads at the 420 strike when the price of the underlying was over 520. Just like I had done all the way up the mountain. I gave myself a decent cushion, or so I thought. I even managed to roll my positions down to 380 for a credit by pushing them out to October. Perhaps there will be another run up and it will be over that strike by then. Perhaps not. I also should have cut my losses after dropping 40k in the first day of this sell-off. But no, I had to hang in there to see if it would go back up. Nope, just more down. 

Thankfully I have not touched my initial capital and was able to get out before that happened, but I've essentially reset myself back to square 1. I am still up for the year, about 30k. Just enough to cover the 21k in options fees I have racked up so far, and a small withdrawal to pay off a credit card that I took out about 2 months ago. Of course, I still get to pay taxes on that.

As for the being thankful... 

I've learned some valuable, and very expensive lessons. Always protect your capital and don't let yourself get wiped out. Cut losses early and look for another play. It's extremely hard to win your money back in this casino when you're out of chips. Sometimes it is extremely easy to make money in the market, and it sure makes it difficult to want to work a regular job when you're bringing in 10-20k per day.

16036,Buy,GME,,pennyether,lxhdv7,108,154,"I've made something to analyze the entire options chain to reveal gamma ramps, charm zones, and IV crush sensitivity -- as it all pertains to theoretical MM delta hedging.  Here's the table for GME.  Feedback is welcomed, as well as your interpretations of the data.

**Faqs:**

* **What is this?**: I take the entire options chain and calculate how many shares options writers theoretically need to delta hedge. This is done for various price points, and at each price point the delta shares' sensitive to price, time, and volatility change are included as well.
* **Why?**: This gives a rough indication of the gamma ramp, as well as what effects changes in price, time, and volatility will have on the flux of delta shares... in theory.
* **About Delta Hedging**: This table provides *only the theoretical amount of delta hedging required.* MM's and other option writers may hedge in a variety of ways non-exclusive to delta hedging.  They may also front-run, or back-run delta hedging (buy shares ahead of time, or after the fact). They may also have a strategy as to how they wish to roll over delta hedged shares from one week to the next, since not all ITM necessarily get delivered.
* **How do I interpret this?**: This data is open for interpretation however you please. In general, price points with high ""1% Price ƒ??flux"" values are high gamma regions -- the stock price should theoretically move with higher volatility through these regions. Price points with high ""24hr ƒ??flux"" values are high charm regions -- time will cause # deltashares to change.  Price points with high ""10% vol ƒ??flux"" values are high vanna regions -- IV crush or explosion will have a large effect on # deltashares.
* **Note: This cannot predict price action**: It's up to you to have an outlook on how the actual price and volatility may change throughout the day.  This only gives you a rough idea of how the tides of deltashares can roll in and out based on your outlook.

**Columns:**

* **Price Point**: The stock price that this row assumes the underlying is at.
* **# Shares DeltaHedged**: At the price point, the theoretical number of shares needed for the entire options chain to be delta hedged.  This is sum total of all contracts' open interest multiplied by their delta and by 100.
* **1% Price DeltaFlux**: Sensitivity to price (~gamma). At the price point, a price movement of 1% will change # Shares DeltaHedged by this much.
* **24hr DeltaFlux**: Sensitivity to time (~charm). At the price point, if time elapsed 24hours the # Shares DeltaHedged would change by this much.
* **10% Vol DeltaFlux**: Sensitivity to Volatility (~vanna). At the price point, if across the entire options chain the implied volatility of each contract increased by 1.10x its current value (eg: from 140% to 154%), the # Shares DeltaHedged would change by this.

No, really, go read it. 

But if you donƒ??t have time, hereƒ??s the important bit: 
The DTCC is practically the insurance of the entire stock market. They set a fee for every trade as collateral (for buyers) and return it when the funds clear. Trade funds take 2 days to clear.

All trades go through clearing houses. They facilitate trades from brokers (*like your favorite trading app*)

Letƒ??s say the upfront fee is 1% for a certain stock. When a $1mil buy order through clearing house A happens, clearing-house A immediately gives $10,000 to DTCC, and starts a wire of $1million to fund clearing-house B (sellers) Once the transaction of $$ from A-B clears, DTCC gives the $10,000 back to clearing house A. 

If it doesnƒ??t clear because Clearing house A doesnƒ??t have enough funds, the DTCC is stuck footing the bill to the sellers at Clearing house B. 

Now, due to the extreme volatility of meme stocks and their potential to skyrocket through the moon and beyond, the DTCC set the collateral fee to 100%, as if the price goes too high *even* the DTCC may not be able to foot the bill. This collateral-hike meant brokers such as ƒ??the trading app that shall not be namedƒ? had to send the DTCC an unprecedented **100%** of the value of buy orders **AND** begin a money wire of the buy order to the sellers of the stock. So, in total, thatƒ??s a *cool* **200%** of every $GME buy transaction made. And so, put simply, some clearing houses did not have the sufficient funds to fulfill buy orders of $GME

**But** **what** **if** **this** **happens** **to** **the** **brokers** **of** **Melvin** **and** **other** **short** **sellers?**

When the price of $GME goes high enough, the short-sellersƒ?? broker *may* (idk I just learned how to read, *this is not financial advice*) not be able to cover the **100%** collateral per trade. This **could** see a rather slow squeeze as shorts can only cover a small amount per day. 

This may cause the price go up incrementally day after day, but only if we **hold**

Many of you are new to this and the vast majority here don't know how to sell anything. Since you love your $AMC, $GME and other meme stonks so much, how about writing/selling calls against them?

What does it mean to write/sell a call? You pick a strike price (not $1000, sorry). The strike price is the price you agree to part with your beloved meme stonks should the price go up bigly again (it won't). You pick the expiration date of the contract. Someone pays you a premium for this, represented as dollars per share. Right now a March 19th $100 strike call is selling for $12.80 a share, or $1,280 in premium. This lowers your cost basis as you get the premium no matter what happens.

If your meme stonk falls, the contract loses value and you can buy it back and sell another if you want. Point is, you make money if the price falls which you aren't currently doing sitting on your shares.

Now for the really smart apes here, you could use the call premium to buy a put and create what's called a collar. A $45 put for instance goes for $1,215 in March. So you would no longer lose money below $45 as you carefully diamond hand your way to oblivion. And it wouldn't cost you anything since the $1,280 call premium covers the $1,215 put cost. You'd even have enough leftover to buy your wife and her boyfriend a mediocre dinner.

Now, this only works for those of you hodling at least 100 shares and of course having a broker which will let you trade options. If you don't have that many shares, sorry. Options contracts trade in blocks of 100 shares.

RKT has burned many people in the past. To some it will always be the ex that hurt you, broke your favorite mixtapes you made just for her, and told your friends you had a small member. 

Hell I get that, but here is why I will continue to bet my money on RKT. I bet on what they are BECOMING. 

RKT is already MORE than a MORTGAGE company, but you wont here that from most ANALysts. 

ROCKET COMPANIES is currently profitable in three major markets. Mortgages, Home Searching(Rocket Homes), and now Rocket Auto. 

I believe this earnings will show the undeniable proof in the success of RKTs branching out. Auto was insanely profitable before it even fully launched in Q2. 

So a couple factors that scream bullish during the current market. 

HOMES sales are not at the record high but are still high, and RKT is now the Number 1 mortgage lender in the country. RKT is aggressively stealing market share from all competitors. With the addition of Rocket Homes they are now directly in competition with zillow. RKT is profitable in every industry they touch. 

Rocket Auto, with this expansion in todays current used vehicle market this is a no brainer. This expansion was profitable before it's actual full launch. 

And finally one that many people are not talking about, Solar. 

RKT will be entering the Solar energy market to offer refinancing packages for customers to take advantage of the Solar energy tax credits and help facilitate and manage installation of solar to homes. 

What makes me the most bullish on RKT is the billions in profit they make every quarter, and the cash and shares on hand they keep for the NEXT BIG IDEA or acquisition.

Everything RKT has dipped its toes into has made them money. 

The last thing that screams out putting my money on the Red Rocket, everyone is telling you its doomed. The ANALysts are screaming SELL, the media is saying doomed, and every bank that they have already beat for the number one spot says it's going down. Everyone that Rocket has stolen market share from screams from the rooftops that they are ONLY a mortgage company.  This stock is so undervalued it makes me sick, excited, and slightly aroused. 

This is a FinTech Stock, and it deserves FinTech recognition. That's why I continue to bet on RKT, because the day rocket gets its deserved valuation will be a week to late.

Okay fellow monkeys- here is the current mortgage play

THE SQUEEZE $RKT

\- As I am sure you are well aware Rocket has been shorted big time by some daft proƒ??s who apparently thought they could push the stock down current price and profit. Now the big squeeze arm wrestle is on and if shorters have any sense they would cover exposure faster than Jeff Epsteins killer. Ilhor from SI reports on the interest and as you can tell the crash is inevitable- where it goes nobody knows but what is certain is it would do so harder than a wedding night dick.

???? ??¯ Andrew Left of Citron broke momentum by posting a price target of $25 for NIO. This was the first big event that caused NIO to plummet, although it did rebound, but many retail and boomer investors were scared off.

Then the House passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. This bill realists foreign stocks that donƒ??t uphold the standard American GAAP American accounting standard. This brought Chinese stocks and NIO under $50 for the first time in weeks. This is super irrational as NIO has been compliant ever since the Senate passed this bill months ago (they even use the same auditer that Tesla uses).

At this point, NIO is being way undervalued and the selloffs were caused by really irrational things and NIO should be a buy already.

All looked well and NIO was consolidating at $45-$47 before two days ago. Then NIO announced a $5B stock issuing (which only diluted shares by 5%) and everyone freaked out and paper handed till NIO sits at the $41 it is sitting at right now.

Well what will this $5B be used for. Rumor has it that NIO will be using it to expand in foreign markets soon and building infrastructure in Europe, etc. ???? if this turns out to be true this could be a huge catalyst for another NIO rally.

This is a fictional account and not investment advice.

# Preface

Today is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.

GME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.

# Where we are at

Today just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports: 

7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER. 

2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( ???? ) and below it is bearish (????). 

4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.

6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)

Not just are we at these multiple areas of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* /u/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1/20/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*

But wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7/15), the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks).

All this being said, today I would put us at or around 3/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.

# Where we are going

All these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).

At the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.

Now, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard. 

# GamePlan

**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close. 

IF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.

Targets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.

IF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut.

**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8/20.

First, forgive me for my cowardice. I should have joined you earlier but I was afraid. I am new to this. In time I hope to grow massive balls like you lot.

I also want to thank citron and andrew cleft. After yesterdayƒ??s ƒ??live streamƒ?? I felt he lacked conviction in his belief, this was evident in the way he spoke. A lot of Ahƒ??s and Umƒ??s, complete lack of charisma and confidence. Subjective but still. That and he did say some stupid things like issuing more shares to pay down debt. Which generally you donƒ??t do (but can). He shouldn't be giving management advice if his goal is to short a share. The most important thing is this, conviction and faith. Have that, which he, and to point I lacked. Already you have seen people who had the balls to jump in make gainz.  Also as u/An_EliteMind_Ihope pointed out, citron is clearly lying, thank you for sharing this friend. 

Also want to thank u/DeepFuckingValue for his hard work. If I miss anybody I apologize. I usually lurk here.

The other thing I want to share is for anyone that was afraid to invest. A few days ago I sold about 814 shares of Nio and realized a gain of about $41,901. I apologize for the proof.

https://imgur.com/a/VFryR9L

Here in Canada half of that is taxable so $20,950. I originally sold to buy BB and PLTR. I still have positions in NIO, I do believe in it and I like how the company is being managed. However, I also purchased GME. The point is this if I get a loss I can net that against my gains. Iƒ??d rather make more money than pay my incompetent government taxes.  Since it is the beginning of 2021 I wonƒ??t have to pay taxes till like May or April of 2022. It also gives me a whole year to sit on this and realize those gains/losses when I need to. Plenty of time to get my shit in order. At the same time, you donƒ??t have to sell. If you get a loss eventually any other position might gain that allows you to plan things out long term. If these companies are doing things you like ride it out. Ride to die. Donƒ??t be a coward. As you have seen others have sold on  poisitions to diversify too.  Just some incentive for you folks. Now I am in Canada, and I am sure the US has similar tax rules. 

That is all I really wanted to say. This last bit is personal. I know I have bugged some of you guyƒ??s for guidance and advice. I want to throw this out there. I do want to get into options trading or learn how to do analysis like you guys. I have somewhat learned by reading these threads and studying independently. I donƒ??t care about being rich, I just hate being a loser in my 30ƒ??s. I am the son of immigrants, and all I have wanted to do is provide for and take care of my family.

20467,Buy,UWMC,,Yoshi69Killer,o2bakx,329,896,"A Look into $UWMC Tells Us it's Undervalued - A Company with Strong Financials and Operations

[UWMC](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC) holds a strong reputation in the mortgage lender business which in turn translates to their large market position in the wholesale channel. With their continued growth from the market outlook, I expect to continue to see strong financials aided by their operational efficiency and their strong IT infrastructure which will help to drive their market share higher.

## Company Overview

**United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:** [**UWMC**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC)**)** is a wholesale lender. The company underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers, correspondents, small banks and local credit unions. The company offers its broker partners direct access to dedicated in-house mortgage advisors as well as their own teams of underwriters and closers. It also provides training, technology, marketing support and more to help its entrepreneurial partners.

For the last 6 years included FY2020, they have been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S by closed loan volume, with approximately 34% market share of the wholesale channel.

**Strategy:** Operating solely as a Wholesale Mortgage Lender and thereby avoiding conflict with partners, independent mortgage advisors and their direct relationship with borrowers. By not competing for the borrower connection and relationship, they believe theyƒ??re able to generate significantly higher loyalty and satisfaction from clients.

## Market Opportunity

* Residential mortgage loan originations continuing to grow
   * Federal Reserve reports residential mortgages to represent the largest segment of the U.S consumer finance market
   * In 2020 annual residential mortgage origination volume reached $3.7T and an average of $2.2T over the last 5 years
   * Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts residential mortgage debt to increase to $12.4T by the end of 2022
      * An increase from FY2020 value of $11.1T
   * Loan origination volumes are continuing to shift to non-bank originators
      * Since 2008, non-bank originators have grown from 32% of the loan origination volume to 79% in 2020
      * Traditional banks have since reduced their footprint in mortgage origination
      * Non-bank originators and servicers have been able to meaningfully grow market share
   * Steady home appreciation driving higher mortgage purchase volume and increased residential mortgage loan originations for purchases

## Investment Thesis: Operational Excellence and Strong Revenues

By focusing solely on the wholesale channel, it provides UWMC with a differentiated, client-centric business model that allows for scaled, efficient and centralized processes and the ability to focus on high-quality loans. FY2020, UWMC closed approx. 561,000 loans, with an average submission to clear to close turn times of 17 days. With an average of 9.8 loans per month per production team member, UWMC outperforms the industry average of 3.5. At this rate, UWMC is able to capture a bigger market share in the growing industry, and in turn, generate attractive financial figures and returns for shareholders.

**Revenue:** In the 4QFY2020 alone, UWMC reported a net income of $1.37B- nearly half of their total net income in 2020. This was approx. a 700% increase YoY (2019-2020) and is expected to continue to rise given the industry outlook and opportunity. UWMC has a clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to operational strength, balance sheet and their liquidity and further enforces their position if there were to be drastic changes in the market that would add to uncertainty (as discussed in Risks)

## Investment Thesis II: Strong IT Infrastructure

UWMCƒ??s own technology platforms and exclusively licensed technology allows them to support clients and borrower to provide a ƒ??best-in-class client experience.ƒ? Their variety of full-service technology platforms is offered to independent mortgage advisors and helps to deliver closely managed end-to-end experience for the borrower from origination through closing. Because of this, their technology platforms give them a competitive edge, helps to drive customer retention and offer the ability to efficiently and quickly achieve closing on loan originations. It is primarily due to their technology that they are able to achieve the faster-than-industry average for closing loans. As well, the technology helps to drive brand recognition and brand loyalty because of their personalized marketing tool offered to the independent mortgage advisors.

## Risks

**Their financial performance is directly affected by, and subject to substantial volatility from changes in prevailing interest rates.** A rise in interest rates and increased inflation expectations in the U.S could lead to stagflation in the coming years. As interest rates rise, refinancing generally becomes a smaller portion of the market as fewer consumers are interested in refinancing their mortgages (refinancing makes up 75% of their mortgage volume). In the mortgage loan business, higher interest rates may also reduce the demand for purchase mortgages as homeownership becomes more expensive. These could affect their financial position and the results of their operations.

**Their financial performance is highly dependent on the U.S residential real estate market conditions.** The U.S residential real estate industry is seasonal and highly affected by changes in general economic conditions. Economic conditions such as interest rates, slowed economic growth, unemployment numbers and wages affecting borrowerƒ??s income and ability to make loan payments directly affect UWMCƒ??s financial position. Negative market conditions can lead to a decrease in loan originations and will result in lower revenues- or lead to an increase in loan delinquencies this increasing UWMCƒ??s expenses for loans serviced.

## Valuation

Using a comps analysis, I found 6 companies of competition to UWM Holdings. Given their recent IPO, I found it hard to estimate revenue numbers and use EV/Revenue to further value the company.

**P/S Ratio:** Using a P/S multiple of 4.27, I arrived at a fair value of $15.23 representing a 50.88% upside.

**P/E Ratio:** With the P/E ratio, I arrived at a fair value of $28.27 representing a 179% implied upside.

**Using a 50/50 weighting system, I arrive at an estimated fair value of $21.75 which would imply approx. 115% upside.**

## Final Thoughts

Given the market opportunity, strong financials and the strong IT infrastructure UWMC brings, I think the company is positioned for solid growth in the coming years. By solely focusing on the wholesale channel, the company offers a competitive edge and presents operational efficiency in generating high-quality loans while also meeting the growing demand.

A Look into $UWMC Tells Us it's Undervalued - A Company with Strong Financials and Operations

[UWMC](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC) holds a strong reputation in the mortgage lender business which in turn translates to their large market position in the wholesale channel. With their continued growth from the market outlook, I expect to continue to see strong financials aided by their operational efficiency and their strong IT infrastructure which will help to drive their market share higher.

## Company Overview

**United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:** [**UWMC**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC)**)** is a wholesale lender. The company underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers, correspondents, small banks and local credit unions. The company offers its broker partners direct access to dedicated in-house mortgage advisors as well as their own teams of underwriters and closers. It also provides training, technology, marketing support and more to help its entrepreneurial partners.

For the last 6 years included FY2020, they have been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S by closed loan volume, with approximately 34% market share of the wholesale channel.

**Strategy:** Operating solely as a Wholesale Mortgage Lender and thereby avoiding conflict with partners, independent mortgage advisors and their direct relationship with borrowers. By not competing for the borrower connection and relationship, they believe theyƒ??re able to generate significantly higher loyalty and satisfaction from clients.

## Market Opportunity

* Residential mortgage loan originations continuing to grow
   * Federal Reserve reports residential mortgages to represent the largest segment of the U.S consumer finance market
   * In 2020 annual residential mortgage origination volume reached $3.7T and an average of $2.2T over the last 5 years
   * Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts residential mortgage debt to increase to $12.4T by the end of 2022
      * An increase from FY2020 value of $11.1T
   * Loan origination volumes are continuing to shift to non-bank originators
      * Since 2008, non-bank originators have grown from 32% of the loan origination volume to 79% in 2020
      * Traditional banks have since reduced their footprint in mortgage origination
      * Non-bank originators and servicers have been able to meaningfully grow market share
   * Steady home appreciation driving higher mortgage purchase volume and increased residential mortgage loan originations for purchases

## Investment Thesis: Operational Excellence and Strong Revenues

By focusing solely on the wholesale channel, it provides UWMC with a differentiated, client-centric business model that allows for scaled, efficient and centralized processes and the ability to focus on high-quality loans. FY2020, UWMC closed approx. 561,000 loans, with an average submission to clear to close turn times of 17 days. With an average of 9.8 loans per month per production team member, UWMC outperforms the industry average of 3.5. At this rate, UWMC is able to capture a bigger market share in the growing industry, and in turn, generate attractive financial figures and returns for shareholders.

**Revenue:** In the 4QFY2020 alone, UWMC reported a net income of $1.37B- nearly half of their total net income in 2020. This was approx. a 700% increase YoY (2019-2020) and is expected to continue to rise given the industry outlook and opportunity. UWMC has a clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to operational strength, balance sheet and their liquidity and further enforces their position if there were to be drastic changes in the market that would add to uncertainty (as discussed in Risks)

## Investment Thesis II: Strong IT Infrastructure

UWMCƒ??s own technology platforms and exclusively licensed technology allows them to support clients and borrower to provide a ƒ??best-in-class client experience.ƒ? Their variety of full-service technology platforms is offered to independent mortgage advisors and helps to deliver closely managed end-to-end experience for the borrower from origination through closing. Because of this, their technology platforms give them a competitive edge, helps to drive customer retention and offer the ability to efficiently and quickly achieve closing on loan originations. It is primarily due to their technology that they are able to achieve the faster-than-industry average for closing loans. As well, the technology helps to drive brand recognition and brand loyalty because of their personalized marketing tool offered to the independent mortgage advisors.

## Risks

**Their financial performance is directly affected by, and subject to substantial volatility from changes in prevailing interest rates.** A rise in interest rates and increased inflation expectations in the U.S could lead to stagflation in the coming years. As interest rates rise, refinancing generally becomes a smaller portion of the market as fewer consumers are interested in refinancing their mortgages (refinancing makes up 75% of their mortgage volume). In the mortgage loan business, higher interest rates may also reduce the demand for purchase mortgages as homeownership becomes more expensive. These could affect their financial position and the results of their operations.

**Their financial performance is highly dependent on the U.S residential real estate market conditions.** The U.S residential real estate industry is seasonal and highly affected by changes in general economic conditions. Economic conditions such as interest rates, slowed economic growth, unemployment numbers and wages affecting borrowerƒ??s income and ability to make loan payments directly affect UWMCƒ??s financial position. Negative market conditions can lead to a decrease in loan originations and will result in lower revenues- or lead to an increase in loan delinquencies this increasing UWMCƒ??s expenses for loans serviced.

## Valuation

Using a comps analysis, I found 6 companies of competition to UWM Holdings. Given their recent IPO, I found it hard to estimate revenue numbers and use EV/Revenue to further value the company.

**P/S Ratio:** Using a P/S multiple of 4.27, I arrived at a fair value of $15.23 representing a 50.88% upside.

**P/E Ratio:** With the P/E ratio, I arrived at a fair value of $28.27 representing a 179% implied upside.

**Using a 50/50 weighting system, I arrive at an estimated fair value of $21.75 which would imply approx. 115% upside.**

## Final Thoughts

Given the market opportunity, strong financials and the strong IT infrastructure UWMC brings, I think the company is positioned for solid growth in the coming years. By solely focusing on the wholesale channel, the company offers a competitive edge and presents operational efficiency in generating high-quality loans while also meeting the growing demand. Going forward, I hope to see increased revenues on their ER and also a changing social sentiment to help drive this stock forward (Reddit sentiment take from [here](https://utradea.com/feed))

Known as a ƒ??gamma squeeze,ƒ? this occurs when the sellers of the call options, in order to hedge their positions, buy the underlying stock.

Successful, established companies trade at a P/E of like, what, 20? Walmart is 20. Amazon is 91. Shopify is 724. Verizon is 13. Bank of America is 16. EA is 31. Tesla is fucking 1621.

If you think Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop around into a profitable, growing company, you should see that the real upside of all this shit isn't a 60% leap, or, fuck it, even a 100% leap today -- this thing's got long term value. We'll see the share price fucking triple when the market at large sees RC get these guys on track. Fucking hold that shit.

Nokia Corporation (NOK)

Market Cap $24.2bn

52 week Range $2.34 to $9.79

This is no longer the company that produced mobile phones and it's a while (8 years) since they moved away from phones when selling the whole division. They are a seamless 5G platform supplier. In fact they are one of only two companies anywhere with the capability to supply a continuous end to end 5g network platform. The other company is Huawei (I shall not swear any more.)

The only issue with Nokia is that they are not forthcoming and the information released to the public very much underplays how well the company is progressing. Previously the opposite approach this has artificially boosted the share price but as the business moves forward this is holding the share price down....and for a very good reason. I have come to suspect, that from several conversations with people I know at large institutions (who avoided talking about Nokia at all costs) that some large positions are being built up stealthily. Previously such avoidance of talking about companies has resulted in SEC filings showing large purchases during the previous quarter. This may be the reason why they didn't dip too far below $4 during the recent market drop.

Back to where Nokia is really at.

About 88% of revenue comes from wireless network infrastructure and products and internet routing equipment. 10 years of acquisitions have seen the transformation into a leading wireless technology company. In 2016 the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent which included Bell Labs. This made them into a potential giant along side the 'H' company and Ericsson.

Powering its ASIC-powered base station and 5G platform with it's new artificial intelligence ReefShark semiconductor saves around 50% energy usage and makes the product cheaper to customers.

This product is the ideal solution for Mobile Virtual Network Operators. There are between 800 and 1200 worldwide. When software development catches up the big tech and social network companies will have their own wireless service running autonomously. There is potential in cities to bring a network up to an astounding capability of over 5Tbps (yes terabytes) that means each loop can have 5000 customers with 1Gbps service. Reefshark makes Nokia the top of the pile in this massive coming market. And unlike Ericsson it's all in house and no need for partners. The 'H' company is banned from a number of significant countries so Nokia is ideally placed to pick up that business.

Nokia are stripping fitter by reducing operating costs and will shed a few thousand jobs. This could save $500M a year. 

At $4.30 the shares are cheap. Apart from a few shrewd institutions Nokia is currently ignored by most of the Wall Street sharks. It's typical of the attitude towards an overseas based company. The institutions that have got the jump on building up their stake in Nokia will be celebrating by the end of the year when the rest of Wall Street wants a piece of the action. $8-$10 is what I am expecting.

The price has crept up every day for the past week and could gather more momentum as the company gets a real grip on their business. It all looks good to me.",NOK DD,44271.6077,t3_m6iq2l,"NOK DD * I am not a financial adviser and your own DD must be carried out prior to trading this stock. *

Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!

In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:

I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)

Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:

As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)

Now what about Fidelity users:

32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)

DEGiro has 600K users:

600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro

What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212

ƒ??

ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct

so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares

ƒ??

Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!

We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM

OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!

Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)

38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available

==============&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!

ƒ??

Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted

67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!

ƒ??

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html

In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.

32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??

ƒ??

TNDLR

Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%

Institutions hold 113 %

Total= 193 % shares are on the market

SO the real Shorts number is 138%

ƒ??

ƒ??

Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be ?œGreedy ::

Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will ""only pay"" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)

Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....

**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrewƒ??s a ??????¯, in long heƒ??s a self proclaimed ƒ??*activist short seller*ƒ?. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*.

Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed ƒ??*activist*ƒ? weƒ??re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : ƒ??He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.ƒ? His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial worldƒ??s scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again ƒ??After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the companyƒ??s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.ƒ? Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didnƒ??t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$844.20** TODAY. If this wasnƒ??t enough wait to hear the companies in his ƒ??*ambitious track record*ƒ?. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He couldƒ??ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the ??????¯ because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**????????????????????????????????????. Diamond hand the fuck out of this stock autists  ????????????????????????????????????. NOW. Is the time.

**SCANDAL #1**. Hereƒ??s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this ??????¯ was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing ƒ??false and/or misleading claimsƒ? about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. Heƒ??s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedoƒ??ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW ??????¯ said theyƒ??re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THEREƒ??S **NO WAY** THEYƒ??RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)

Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now iƒ??m pretty sure if youƒ??ve been active on the sub youƒ??ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. Iƒ??ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).

Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why heƒ??s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.

We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citronƒ??s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY.

Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed ƒ??*activist*ƒ? weƒ??re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : ƒ??He can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.ƒ? His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial worldƒ??s scrutiny.

Now, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again ƒ??After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the companyƒ??s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.ƒ? Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didnƒ??t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). SERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$844.20** TODAY. If this wasnƒ??t enough wait to hear the companies in his ƒ??*ambitious track record*ƒ?. 

Since all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He couldƒ??ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the ??????¯ because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**????????????????????????????????????. Diamond hand the fuck out of this stock autists  ????????????????????????????????????. NOW. Is the time.

**SCANDAL #1**. Hereƒ??s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this ??????¯ was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing ƒ??false and/or misleading claimsƒ? about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. Heƒ??s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).

**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedoƒ??ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW ??????¯ said theyƒ??re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THEREƒ??S **NO WAY** THEYƒ??RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)

Now these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now iƒ??m pretty sure if youƒ??ve been active on the sub youƒ??ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. Iƒ??ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).

Apart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why heƒ??s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.

NOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more ????????????????????????????????????. We will be hit badly again, the boomer investors cannot take Citronƒ??s cock out of their mouths, so we expect a sell off, DO NOT GIVE THE BEARS A CHANCE TO BUY. Today could even be a red day, **BUT FEAR NOT**. We will hopefully emerge victorious. I AM SO PROUD OF EVERY LAST AUTIST ON HERE ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????.

TL;DR : Citronƒ??s been doing this for a long time. The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution. HOLD ON TO YOUR STOCKS WITH DIAMOND HANDS ????????????????????????????????????. HOARD AND HOLD. EVEN A RED DAY OR TWO WONƒ??T EXTINGUISH THE FLAME IN WSB.

I've bought into some of the most valuable stocks in my time, and I've noticed I have a certain special ability that might be of use here at r/wallstreetbets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's not all! Some of the other bullish stocks I've managed to chop off at the knee are:

PLTR , VOO, VT, SPY, SSY, TELL, UAVS, UBER, RKT, SDGR, QQQ, MSFT, AAPL, XRT, and YOLO. As a secondary power, I've noticed that each one has seen at least a little spike in price since my selling. It's only cheap for as long as I own it.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'd failed at an investment in just a few of these stocks, I'd call it a fluke, but my investment history has a loss rate sitting at somewhere around 95%. That's not chance, that's certainty. That's fate. I'd bet my life on those kinds of odds. That's not bad luck, that's a goddamn super-power.

I understand that some of you may be skeptical, so I've decided to take this opportunity to run a real-life, superb experiment to see if I'm incompetent, or have reverse-control over reality. Recommend any stock of reasonable price, and I will buy in first thing tomorrow morning (I'll try to give y'all time to liquidate your own shares first, but sometimes just my intention to buy something will make the price start to plummet). If my powers are correct, we should see a massive dip in that stock within a week. After a week, I will sell, and the stock should return to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

If this does turn out to be a predictable trend, I would be happy to render my services. The way I see it, here's the plan:

1) Pick Stock

2) Pick Entry Time

3) I will buy a MASSIVE amount of stock 1 week prior. This guarantees a daily loss in value. The bear attack will likely lose 50% of its momentum each day, so a 5 day run will be most effective before value is dropping too slowly to be worth it.

4) Everyone buys in at market open the following day. 1hr into market open, I will liquidate shares, ensuring a bull run so strong that each and every one of you will become a millionaire. This bull run lasts as long as the stock holds my attention, likely another 5 days.

5) Each of you contributes 1% of your earnings to a kickstarter, which will then be used to rescue me from the excruciating losses I am bound to continue suffering.

The stock gets some momentum, and suddenly the price targets people would have been fully stoked to get suddenly seem like poultry gains in comparison to the 100x price targets anons start to shit post on here.

If I had any advice, it is this: stick with that original price target you would have been fully stoked to get before you read all those 100x shit post price targets. I can (unfortunately) say from multiple experiences that bagging your original price target, even if you donƒ??t sell at the exact top, is so much better that watching the price crater under your original price target because you got greedy and held to long. 

BRING ON THE ACCUSATIONS OF ME BEING A SHILL - IT ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER. The truth is that a lot of those price target shit posters are the ones shilling you, as they want you to hold your position for as long as possible so the price runs up and they can sell at their own price target (which is lower than the one they were shit posting about). 

Some of you may recognize me from my own shit posting hobby on the daily threads. Iƒ??m not a shill, Iƒ??m just a guy that could be a hell of a lot richer during GME if I didnƒ??t let anons convince me the big money was going to let the price go to $1000 a share, which became my price target. 

Unfortunately I loaded up on some positions I believe in so I donƒ??t have a lot of money in BBBY - 134 shares @ $6.74. Wish I had more, but Iƒ??m up like 100% so thatƒ??s chill.

Here is my analysis:

* **Charlie Bucket** - Throughout the movie and the book, Charlie is represented as the typical retail investor ???.  
* **Willy Wonka** - (sometimes represented as a bandana-wearing ""Not-a-Cat"" cunning analyst) informs the retail investors ??? of his analysis of a particular stock that he likes.  And if you like the candy (stock) ??ª, buy it, as it may have a golden ticket. ???®
* Large corporations ??› buy large amounts of candy (stock) ??ª because they believe Willy Wonka's candy factory (Gamestop) ??ø  is going to fail. 
* After sometime passes, the large corporations' plan fails as retail investors start finding golden tickets ???® in the candy ??ª they purchase causing more retail investors to buy.
* With candy supplies ??ª being so low, corporations need to buy candy at higher costs ????.  Not liking this, the corporations ??› restrict limits on the amount of candy ??ª which can be purchased.
* One day, with the coordination of the media, a corporate good shows up on television and states the final golden ticket ???® has been found.  This sends the price of candy ??ª crashing.
* Charlie finds a dollar and buys a few bars of candy.  Inside the bar, he finds a golden ticket. ???®  The corporation has been lying about their position all long.  The price of candy ??ª increases. ????  All this time, Charlie had ???????.

***Willy Wonka's Factory Guests*** ??ø 

* **Augustus Gloop** - Augustus loves chocolate.??®  The moment, he saw the chocolate river (gains), he fell in the river, getting stuck in the pipe.  Augustus had paper hands.  Augustus should have held. 
* **Violet Beauregarde** - Violet chewed gum all the time.  When she saw the new chewing gum prototypes, her dad urged her to keep on chewing despite the others in the group to stop.  As Violet was turning into a big blueberry ???æ, her dad cheered her on.  The Oompa-Loompas had to roll her out of the roll her out of the room and de-juice her.  Her dad was a corporate shill and did not care about her position.  He put his own interests before hers.  He would be encouraging stockholders to do things that would damage their positions to benefit his or his hedge funds.
* **Veruca Salt** - When Veruca saw the squirrels ??¨ opening the nuts ???ø, she wanted one right away.  She insisited on obtaining a nut ???ø opening squirrel ??¨ instead of practicing patience.  When she tried to steal a squirrel ??¨, they ganged up on her, throwing her in the nut ???ø chute.  Veruca needs to learn that you cannot rush a squeeze.  You need to practice patience.  Her dad was going to buy a squirrel ??¨.  That's what you do during a squeeze: buy and wait.
* **Mike Teavee** - After going to the TV room ???§, the group is told Wonka-vision is going to revolutionize the world.  Mike Teavee was going to have none of that and immediately gets on the the stage and transports himself to a smaller state.  Mike Teavee is the ultimate case of Buy High ????, Sell Low ????.

The soda ??? causes Charlie and Grandpa Joe to fly and almost hit a ventilation fan.  Thankfully, Charlie finds a way to get out of the position and they are both safe.  Grandpa may be a corporate shill and tried to distract Charlie with worthless positions so he can take advantage of Charlie's position.  Do not get distracted.  Stay focused on your own goal.
* ***Arthur Slugworth*** - Before entering the factory, Arthur Slugworth bribes Charlie to commit sabotage by sneaking out an Everlasting Gobstopper ???.  Later in the movie, Slugworth turns out to be someone employed by the Wonka factory to test if Charlie can be trusted.  Some posters can be trusted with their posts, others cannot.  It is up to you to investigate if their gain porn or loss porn is fabricated.  Is their Due Diligence accurate or not?  Is their YouTube stream paid for by hedges or are they grifting?

I work in the film &amp; tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state. 

But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.

**Quick Facts:**  
1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.   
2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.  
**And here's the banger:**  
3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected 1.5-billion), Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these. 

This is bad for the studies because their ""great"" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day. 

**Pent-Up Demand:**  
Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to 5.5-billion in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions). 

When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand. 

If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers 

**Another possibility:**  
If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC. 

TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.",Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director,44230.44653,t3_lbt8yz,"Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director \*Not Financial Advice.

Clean Energy is a leading renewable energy company focused on the procurement and distribution of renewable natural gas, and conventional natural gas, in the form of compressed natural gas, and liquefied natural gas for the United States and Canadian transportation markets. Renewable natural gas, which is delivered as either compressed or liquified natural gas, is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane, or biogas, from non-fossil fuel sourcesƒ??ƒ??ƒ??such as dairy and other livestock waste and landfillsƒ??ƒ??ƒ??for beneficial use as a replacement for fossil-based transportation fuels.

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Clean Energy is focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste projects and supplying renewable natural gas (procured from their own projects or from third parties) to their customers in the heavy and medium-duty commercial transportation sector. Clean Energy has participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for over 20 years and will argue they are the largest U.S. provider of renewable natural gas for commercial transportation. Clean Energy is in a unique position because valuable Environmental Credits are generated by the party that dispenses renewable natural gas into vehicle fuel tanks, and they have access to more dispensers than any other market participant.

As a comprehensive clean energy solutions provider, Clean Energy:

* designs and builds, as well as operates and maintains, public and private vehicle fleet customer stations in the United States and Canada
* sells and services compressors and other equipment used in renewable natural gas production and at fueling stations
* transports and sells their fuels via ƒ??virtualƒ? natural gas pipelines and interconnects
* sells U.S. federal, state and local government credits, which they collectively refer to as Environmental Credits, they generate by selling renewable natural gas as a vehicle fuel
* obtains federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives

On April 19, 2021, Clean Energy announced an [agreement with Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-agreement-with-amazon-for-low-and-negative-carbon-rng-01618826728?tesla=y) to provide low and negative carbon RNG. Fuel will be provided at 27 existing Clean Energy fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations by the end of the year. This will provide renewable natural gas in 15 different states. Additionally, on May 11, 2021, Chevron announced they were investing an additional $20M in the [Adopt-a-Port initiative](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-clean-energy-fuels-extend-adopt-a-port-initiative-to-reduce-emissions-01620727503?tesla=y) with Clean Energy to provide cleaner, more carbon-negative renewable natural gas.

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Clean Energy began to see the negative effects of COVID-19 on volumes delivered in mid-March 2020 and continued to see declines in volumes delivered through December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. Their volumes bottomed in the second quarter of 2020 and improved through year-end albeit at a slower pace than expected, with volumes delivered for the fourth quarter of 2020 increasing 7% over the second quarter of 2020. While volumes delivered in December 2020 were 2% lower compared to December 2019, this decline was lower than the decline of 4% when comparing September 2020 to September 2019. The most significant negative effects of COVID-19 in relation to Clean Energy volumes were experienced in the airports (fleet services) and public transit customer markets, which were down by between 15% and 31% during 2020 compared to 2019 due to federal, state and local government mandates to restrict normal daily activities, as well as travel bans, quarantines and ƒ??shelter-in-placeƒ? orders.

Other risk factors Clean Energy may face include:

* The willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt Clean Energy vehicle fuels, which may be influenced by certain of the factors, many of which are beyond their control.
* Competition in the market for vehicle fuels generally, and the nature and effect of competitive developments in the market
* Suppliersƒ?? ability to successfully develop and operate projects and produce expected volumes of renewable natural gas, particularly in light of a long and variable development cycle that requires significant resource commitments
* The potential commercial viability of livestock waste and dairy farm projects to produce renewable natural gas
* The development and production of vehicles and engines in key customer and geographic markets by vehicle and engine manufacturers, over which Clean Energy has no control

**CONCLUSION**

I am bullish on Clean Energy and I agree they are currently undervalued. Clean Energy serves fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users, and government fleets. I believe these fleet markets will continue to present a growth opportunity for Clean Energy vehicle fuels for the foreseeable future.

TL:DR because reading is for mooks: both major rides in stock price are mainly attributed to gamma squeezed.

Rockets ???? and moons ???.

I think we are mostly on the same page that what happened Friday was a gamma squeeze. 

The maximum option strike price for GME was $60 expiring Friday.  There were over 32k 60c contracts and at noon they were in the money. The total call contracts were something around 150k calls all expiring January 22nd. 

This causes option writers to buy more shares to hedge  the contracts they wrote. 

The price was moving so fast they couldn't hedge fast enough leading to massive amounts of shares needing to be bought all at once. 

This means the short squeeze still hasn't finished, potentially hasn't started based in shorts doubling down. 

End of day Friday every call option was in the money, which means those shares (over 15 million shares) will need to be given to the contract holders. 

Every put options was out of the money, something like 80k puts (when I checked the chain mid-day Friday) expired worthless. That's 8 million shares worth of contacts and money lost for those who held puts. 

For those who had calls, the 15 million shares, they will probably settle on Tuesday and be held by those who had the calls. This is 20% of the total float that is now more or less unavailable to short. That makes it even MORE difficult for the shorts to cover and close their positions. 

The Short squeeze may start this coming week, if not very soon.

Itƒ??s ya boy here, ElJefe and boyyyyyy do I have something to share with you!

Hold onto your seats, but what Iƒ??m about to share IS a doozy and it might help make a lot of connections with what the fuck is going on related to this whole GME fiasco, that is now turning into some chance opportunity for $SLV to return to the main stage as another **ƒ??squeeze opportunityƒ?.**

Listen we all should know by now that the news we are shown is mostly used to control a narrative for a certain group and this is **NO DIFFERENT OF A TIME**.  The thing that is so unique with this situation is how intertwined things are more than you are lead to believe. 

Does anyone find it amazing that 1 company Robinhood) was able capture the attention of millions upon millions of NEW retail investors by simply creating an app that is understandable and is easy to use? Think of it, Robinhood opened the door to change peopleƒ??s lives by guiding them through the transaction process for stocks and people started to open their eyes and realize that making money to sustain your life doesnƒ??t need to take a whole bunch of your time away from you. 

So here is where the story begins.

Robinhood as many of you know was **heavily** funded by a Market Maker that is known as Citadel (previously Wellington management, which was founded in 1933 by Walter L. **Morgan**(weird coincidence, but maybe popular name in the day ???Ÿ) as the first balanced mutual fund).

Citadel not only is a market maker, but they also are the providers of a certain component of the transaction process known as immediate or cancel interface. Check out ƒ??Citadel Connectƒ? - which essentially is known for the immediate or cancel interface that is baked directly into the transaction process for Brokerages. So they have their hand in a lot of cookie jars across brokerages, to say the least. They also provide a system of algorithmic trading that helps automatic trading for their clients and more! Check out their website, it is eye opening the power this single company really has over the exchange. 

Now keep in mind from before, Citadel gave Robinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** to get them going because they saw a huge opportunity with having **MORE** retail traders joining the party and that opportunity was **DATA**. Citadel has instant and live trading data access to every single trade you make (hence why you usually notice an immediate opposing force from the stock you are buying - buy call and stock goes down right away, buy put and stock goes up right away), this is not something you are imagining, Citadels algorithm is literally taking this data in real time, and placing the most favorable trade for Citadel, which usually starts mind fucking you with your position right off the bat. Remember emotional trading will always lose, and they fuck with your emotions IMMEDIATELY (usually).

So Robinhood ƒ??&gt; Citadel.

Next is JP Morgan. The banker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *Morgan* started the original Citadel (Wellington), remember? Seems like a killer coincidence! Is Walter somehow related to John Pierpont? Even if indirectly, they bear the same family name... hmmm weird, but I canƒ??t seem to find any relation on good old Google! So weƒ??ll leave this just as a coincidence. 

Back to JP Morgan - they would be the next in line to pay up or default and they are fully aware of the immensity of an infinite squeeze and now are in a position where they would be ones losing huge amounts of money. They have a lot of smart people working for them that quickly caught onto this and starting creating a contingency plan of some kind of to recoup some of the losses they are about to experience.

**This is where $SLV/Silver comes into play and WHY YOU ARE SEEING IT POP UP MORE FREQUENTLY.**

For those who unaware, $SLV is the ishares Silver Trust (which is blackrockƒ??s silver etf). The silver squeeze **IS** something to have happened before and guess who was able to benefit **SIGNIFICANTLY** off of the sell off of the last $SLV rally... JP Morgan. Howƒ??d they do this? **They shorted the fuck out of it.** Check out JP Morganƒ??s history with the precious metals market - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. They paid, but still made out like bandits with profits. 

Weird how when JP Morgan is about to lose a metric fuck ton of money, $SLV all of a sudden becomes ƒ??viralƒ? and we start seeing it popping up everywhere as the ƒ??next squeezeƒ?, but maybe just a coincidence, right? 

Recap Robinhood ƒ??&gt; Citadel ƒ??&gt; JP Morgan would be the defaulted order. JP Morgan will need to recoup losses somehow, and what better way then A short on Silver whilst writing options during the run up?

Hence why $SLV has became viral.

So in essence. Stay the fuck away from Silver unless you really know what youƒ??re doing. Our mission is to focus on ???????ý??¯ing GME. **EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEING** ***SHILLED*** **IS A DISTRACTION**. 



Also, Citadel should be another entity we are burning at the stake, not just Robinhood.

If you have not heard of the prisoner's dilemma, here is a quick rundown. 

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison

If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison

If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in 
prison and B will be set free

If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

In our case snitching is selling, and holding is remaining silent. And the jail sentence is ""losing your money"", so by selling you won't ""lose"".

As you can see in the prisoner's dilemma it is most logical that the two gang members will snitch on each other in order to look out for themselves - even though it is the worst decision. The thing is in reality however, humans have shown a great deal of co-operation.

The reality is that people will hold, and by not holding you ultimately fuck yourself over as well as the rest of everyone else. So while it might seem rational selling, the truth is it is more rational holding.

4283,Buy,GME,,Start155,l4ccqc,1,304,"A lot of new visitors and members are here trying to understand what is exactly happening with this GME stock. Here is my understanding

1. **Buy share and hold:** 

* By doing this you will be reducing the available share to short which will enhance the squeeze. 
* You will also eliminating the paper hand players from the field who buy at high and panic sell if SP drops by 5-10%. 
* You will be creating a buy pressure which will drive the SP higher. If SP goes higher then option seller/market makers (MM) need to buy stocks to hedge their position to reduce their downside risk. 
* Buying huge amount of share by MM will drive the stock even higher that will create a margin call to the accounts that sold GME short. 
* A margin call will force the short seller to buy stocks at higher price that will create more buying pressure and drive the SP even higher. 
* Buy you already bought most of the available share from the float so the stock price will go very high.

This might not happen is a day. It might take few weeks to few months but the point is to buy and hold the shares. Did you miss the run from $16 to $20? What about $20 to $40? What about $40 to $60? All these happened under a month! Well you don't have to miss it anymore. Buy and hold the share.

2.  **Buy slightly OTM calls dated out at least few months (only if you have experience with options):**

* Market makers need to delta hedge to reduce risk. What is that means exactly? Well from the definition, of a call option is a contract to buy 100 shares at a specific price (strike price). Which means whoever is selling a call should have 100 shares so that if the call is exercised the seller can deliver 100 stocks to the call buyer. Now market makers don't really hold 100 shares for every call option they sell because a lot of the option expire worthless and they never need to deliver those stocks to the call buyers. So, they follow delta which means if a call option has a delta of 0.3 then they will hold only 30 shares (0.3\*100) instead of 100. Now as the SP goes closer to strike price and expire date, delta goes closer to 1. In that case option seller must buy 100 shares so that they can deliver those share to the call buyers. I have only talked about the delta hedge here, there are gamma squeeze and some other complicated phenomena I have avoided to make this post less complicated. 

So, you see by buying and holding a heavily shorted stock you can greatly increase your return of investment. And by buying calls you can multiply that return even higher but you can lose all the money as well (only with options). 

**TlDr**: Buy GME share and hold it. Do not sell if the price goes down short term.

Why am I in this stock?

Earnings growth is superior to most other companies. Corsair Gaming (CRSR) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.33 per share on revenue of $472.9 million. This represents about a 22% increase from last year despite the economy reopening! Imagine what 2022 will look like once the computer chip shortages have ended!

CRSR probably draws the attention from the Reddit crowd with a high short interest of 37% of the float, along with cheap valuations. This stock has been beaten down lately for no reason in my opinion.

CRSR recently refinanced their debt, meaning they will pay a lower interest rate increasing their earnings per share. They have also committed to paying off an addition 47 million in debt by the end of the year.

The company said it continues to expect 2021 revenue of $1.90 billion to $2.10 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $2.02 billion for the year ending December 31, 2021. The market cap for this stock is only around $2.5 billion.

CRSR recently entered in to the camera market and the monitor market. This company continues to innovate and steal market share from competitors.

This company should be able to grow at 10-15% each year through the next decade making this a no brainer. Buckle up apes, we are going on a steep vertical ride to the moon. Corsair Gaming has been disrespected by Wallstreet but they can't stop us!

We went from 1.5M to 7M in the shortest period of time. This is ridiculous.

4355,Hold,GME,,iamaustincince,l561g2,1,159,"Alright autists. Now, I know there's a lot of technical analysis that will tell you to hold GME and you absolutely should. I want to tell you something else: we have the energy of the world on our side.

For those of you who are not familiar with Tarot, it's a deck of cards that tell you what will happen. Not what might happen, what **WILL** happen.  And if you don't want to read this whole thing, I will tell you this: we have literally everything pointing to success.

I kept it simple and did a Journey Spread of 7 cards to pull and I wrote explanations so even the dumbest of us can understand just how fucking ready we are. LESSS GOOO!

# Cards 1 - 3: Leaving - What are we leaving behind as we go on our journey, what is holding us back.

*Processing img xkpmjgailld61...*

1) Ten of Swords - Swords rarellllly mean anything good and the Ten of Swords is a defining card in that suit. ToS (!!!!!!) represents misfortune, desolation, burdens to bear, ruin, the end of delusions. Very few people thought GME was going anywhere, me included. I was wrong. It's going to the moon so we have to leave that shit behind.

2) Ten of Pentacles - Getting a bunch of 10s here (obviously referencing that GME is getting to 100 at the open). But the ten of pentacles is important for us to leave behind because this bitch wants you to enjoy the affluence you already have achieved. I gotta say fuck that because you know what's better than a lambo? Two fucking lambos filled with hookers and all the blow you could want. Also peanut butter snacks.

3) Five of Swords - Have you ever fought a goose? Geese are notoriously shitty. We, as a society, made a fucking video game about why they suck. FoS is a sign of discord and conflict turning you away from your fellow autists. This is the sign that we need to leave the selfishness behind and band together to beat back the cabal of Melvin, Shitron, and whoever else feels like they haven't lost enough money already. They are the geese. Fuck geese.

# Card 4: Why - This card tells you why you are being called to embark on this journey.

4) Knight of Pentacles - If you have any doubts about why we're doing this, this dragon-riding motherfucker wants you to stay the fucking course. You know why we're doing this? Because we fucking know where this is going and we're riding our motherfucking dragons all the way to the moon.

# Card 5: Star - What is guiding or leading you on this journey.

https://preview.redd.it/6nj50qgunld61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=115e14b2693d07c30a1e8fcc14ca7536eda62aa7

5) Queen of Pentacles - I've pulled so many pentacles in this spread due to the inherent nature of their financial metaphor in most of the tarot world. In this case, the KWEEN of money is showing us the way. She's telling you that we can rely on her energy, sharing it all with us dumbasses who put our life's savings into GME. Look, we are all getting our energy from u/DeepFuckingValue. Like I said, this shit is never wrong.

# Card #6: Challenge - This card shows a challenge you will face on your journey.

https://preview.redd.it/84svlh8nold61.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06075d8d22fc276901b25d24ebf4a9a3730ee8b4

6) King of Wands - The king of BDE himself. He represents every motherfucking hedge fund pussy waiting for you to sell so they can buy their yacht and bang our girlfriend. He's relentless in changing the rules and trying to fuck us over so that he can make bonus numbers. This is what we're up against and we can't give in even when they're shooting dragon energy out of their backs.

# Card #7 - Destination: This card shows what you are moving toward. This is the place that you (or your higher self) will reach.

*Processing img uqw62cklpld61...*

7)  XX Judgement - A major arcana as our destination? Hold your tits people. She's literally playing the song of destiny calling us towards more tendies than you could imagine. This is a new start for all of us once we triple our networths. There could not be a more telling sign except:

# BONUS ENERGY PULL

HELL FUCKING YESSSSSSS. In the olden days, Egyptians saw lizards as the guardians of good fortune and divine wisdom. Today, they will be the fucking mascot of us winning our tendies and guard our new wealth. It's already ours people.

I also did some more research after reading some of the more surface level posts on CLNE and found that they built their stations near existing Amazon warehouses, which gives them an advantage when negotiating future deals as transportation of materials is factored into negotiations (from what I know, I work as a software engineer for a steel manufacturing business). 

CLNE has also not even reached itƒ??s all time high of $16 yet (even with a 8.5% after hours gain), whereas most of the other meme'd stocks have well surpassed their's and are in the pump-and-dump territory that leads to a lot of paper handing. Not blaming anyone, gains are gains.

For example, lets take Tesla. Iƒ??m a bear on it and expect a 5-10% drawdown by next week. I can buy 10/22 puts. But the ATM puts go for 2000 a pop. Lets say I buy one and Tesla tanks $50 by Friday, closing at 815. I only make 3k on that trade. 

Now lets say I bought five dollar wide debit spreads at the 825-820 mark for that same $2000 in premium. They go for $93 a pop. If TSLA drops to 820 I make 400 dollars PER spread. 

Divide 2000/93 and you get 21.5 which means you can buy 21 spreads. If TSLA closes at 815, you go beyond your lower 820 strike and collect the full five dollar premium between both strikes. Instead of making 3k, you make $8200 if TSLA closes below 820 on expiry. In order to make the same amount of money from a naked option, TSLA would have to move another $50 by Friday for the same return. Itƒ??s retarded. 

They also get progressively get juicier the lower you go, but donƒ??t go crazy because the options market is efficiently priced. 

People donƒ??t realize how much money you can make on this shit and how superior it is to naked options during earnings. 

You are essentially selling an option against your long option which sells back premium and reduces your volatility and theta exposure A LOT. This is CRUCIAL during earnings. 

I chose TSLA because it has a very big skew to the put side and the delta of the 820 strike was .25 when I bought (meaning the options market is giving it a 25% probability of being ITM by expiry. Iƒ??m getting 6-1 returns and have 1 in 4 odds so itƒ??s a +EV play.

4419,Buy,GME,,AaronTheDakotan,l512w5,2,554,"Hello GME investors and lurkers!

I think we can all agree on the fact that today was a roller-coaster of emotions. I had to do a lap around the office when the share price hit $135, but we know how it would fall to $76.79 EOD price per share. It is fair to say that a few of you guys are a bit nervous about this, as you may have bought-in at a high price; however, I hope to show you with math that you should keep your ƒ?????????? strong and sturdy like u/DeepFuckingValue, as I feel like we can get a close appropriation to the height of this gamer fueled ride.

Before I get to the calculation portion, I just want to say that I believe that we need to stop comparing GME to the Volkswagon Squeeze. u/Fage138 did a great write up [and I recommend giving it a read](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4f9xz/why_the_volkswagen_squeeze_stopped/). This is a different beast entirely, and we must avoid selling to reach the goal of $1,000+ per share. u/Kintsugi2 has pointed out in [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ypu3/gme_watch_out/) to look out for the short-seller's moves, as well as u/Blizzgarg on how the stock was [attacked by the institutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4zbff/today_was_a_coordinated_attack_by_institutions/) that are holding the tendies we will sow. Now on to the math:

&amp;#x200B;

* The float dropped today from 141% to just 139%, which leads to a total of 2%.
* That 2% helped skyrocket the stock price to $159.18 a share, from Friday's EOD of 65.01
* That means that the 2% gave GME a stock jump of nearly 41% or just 20.5% per 1% of the float
* What happens if we apply this percentage for the remaining 139% on today's EOD of $76.79?
* We get an answer that looks like this:
   * **PERCENTAGE CALCULATION**
      * (% Quantity x % per Share) = 139 x 20.5 = 2,849.5% 
      * Note - It is not 139% x 20.5% or 139 x 20.5%, as that would just give you a percentage of a percentage or number. Each 1% is equal to a 20.5% stock price increase.
   * **PRICE PER SHARE CALCULATION**
      * \[(Percentage Calc. x EOD Price) + EOD Price\] = (2,849.5% x 76.79) + 76.79 =  2,264.92
   * **TOTAL VALUE**
      * *$2,264.92 per share.*

&amp;#x200B;

Take note that my calculation will change based on the float remaining % and the EOD price of GME's shares. I hope this will help comfort some of you who are nervous about investing a lot of your money into this, but you have to keep the faith! Unlike some of the more stock-smart investors here, I am not a chart reader. All I am is a guy who grew up surrounded by farmers and farmland, and have learned that you have to make sure the soil, seeds, moisture levels, and weather are at a point to determine if it will be a good harvest this year. In my eyes, GME can be the crop of the decade.

GME has this with a new CEO, Ryan Cohen and gang, and a new direction for the future of gaming &amp; PC part supplier &amp; assembler. Their moves showed a strong indicator of a turnaround from their old fashioned ways, and it is why I am invested in them right now with 350 shares at an average cost of $77.10 a share. Days like this show how much we say the price does not matter, but it still does. This is a normal thing for anyone to have, and you should not ignore it; however, you have to do your own due diligence when it comes to investing, and I hope you have been making good moves. 

Just to be clear, this is NOT financial advice on whether you should or should not invest in GME. This post is just here to help reassure those who feel like they are going down a sinking ship, or got in at the top and will lose it all. I am not much of a poster, and more of a commentator in any subreddit; however, I want you guys to know what I had come up with, and would love to hear any/all feedback you may have for me and my calculations. Please pay any winnings you make forward to a donation towards a helpful charity of your choice as well. r/WSBGivesBack is something we can do to not get fame and karma but to help those less fortunate than ourselves.

So interesting that I dare predict a short squeeze could happen as early as tomorrow. The magnitude of the squeeze is something that will be hard to tell, and could be dependent on factors currently unknown to us, but it will definitely be an early christmas present for many. 

**What does it mean to be listed on the threshold list and what happens on the 13th consecutive day?**

The Regulation SHO Threshold Security List was created by the SEC in 2005 to reduce naked short selling. Stocks appear on this list when at least 0.5% of shares outstanding failed to be settled for 5 consecutive days or more. If a stock is on the list for 13 consecutive trading days, participants will be forced to close any settlement failures (a.k.a cover the naked shorts).

**Is GME on the threshold list?**

You bet. 12 consecutive trading days starting from 8th December 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day would fall on 24th December 2020. Shorts will be forced to cover tomorrow basically.

**Has this happened before?**

Yes. 12 consecutive days starting from 22 September 2020. Quick maths mean the 13th consecutive day fell on 8th October 2020.

**So there will be squeeze tomorrow? By how much?**

I am not a prophet but I am confident a squeeze will happen tomorrow. How much would be up to your own conclusion. All I can say is that back in October, almost everyone and their wives' boyfriend were bearish on GME other than the few OGs we have here. Ryan Cohen only had a 9% stake, GME gang and their theories were laughed off. Shorts were able to cover and close their naked shorts stealthily and without much trouble. 

This time round, Cohen upped his stake to 13%. WSB Capital has entered the foray with approximately 5% stake, which will probably be watered down to 2.5% of diamond hands stake.  Senvest Management has entered with a 5% stake as well. Hedgeye with 90k twitter followers sets a PT of $50 for GME. Some big player has been buying lots of GME shares for the past 2 days. 30M and 25M volume respectively. There are still 68M shares short at the moment. The market closes early tomorrow at 1pm. Shorts will have to buy a shitload amount of shares in half a trading day. Don't forget, GME is attracting a lot of attention from FOMOs and boomers with the Hedgeye tweet. Shorts will have to compete with all these buyers to cover. True available float should be much lower this time round with more big players in, and retail investors knowing about the potential short squeeze, and most importantly pure autistic energy.

Paper handed b\*tches running wild throughout the streets jerking off as soon as the feeling comes, but diamond hands know holding it down results in the greatest pleasure of all.  As many posts have mentioned, BBBY is following the exact same path as GME.  Why?  What is driving it?  What's making it such a pleasure to wake up everyday?  The answer is here.  

1. The short squeeze.  YES, the short squeeze. Not referring to you nerds jerking off on a Wednesday to the BBBY chart.  Right now the short interest is 46%, more than enough juice to squeeze, and the squeeze is cuming.  
2. Exercised calls.  YES, you cockmuffins talking about capturing as much extrinsic value as possible by not ever exercising your calls; you're abandoning your fellow soldiers.  Exercise them glutes!  Make the shorts pay for their arrogance by blowing BBBY Beyond the Moon, Beyond Mars, to Uranus and Beyond.  
3. Market Cap weight indexes.  What dis mean?  It means the more we buy, the more they buy!  If we blow up BBBY, the institutional whales MUST, by definition of their fund, buy BBBY.  If we don't sell, then that buying pressure increases the market cap of BBBY even more, meaning they  will need to buy even more to balance their index, and so on until BBBY reaches infinity. 
4. Diamond Hands.  We apes now control the MAJORITY of the float.  What does that mean?  It means the price will not maintain any sort of downtrend UNLESS we fold and sell our dignity to the algos.  You wouldn't sell your mother to the algos, so why TF would you sell BBBY??  

One last bit of DD.  Buy Buy Baby is a massive play on the pandemic baby boom.  Anecdotally, my sister just got pregnant out of wedlock; babies are coming.  That's it, that's all there is.  If we buy, exercise and hold, we will win, and we will win big; it's simply a mathematical certainty.

AMC is not GME. AMCƒ??s management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from &gt;50% to &lt;10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You arenƒ??t buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isnƒ??t actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.

ƒ?› The company has 4 employees? Obviously not. It was merged back in January with a SPAC run by Chamath Palihapitiya which is a guy known for supporting meme-rising stocks like GME and AMC. So P.P. Pretty much owns the company as far as Iƒ??m concerned.

ƒ?› the inflation numbers that came out definitely hurt SPACƒ??s in general, plus with a huge spike the price was coming down regardless. I sold most at the top and made great gains but depending on tomorrow if it drops lower Iƒ??m dropping everything back into it for longer term.

Wanna talk about irrational? Irrational is to value GameStop at $4, with ~$2 in cash per share, a few months before a new console cycle is launched. Irrational is to keep naked short selling well above its available free float (morning start shows the most accurate free float imo) a company that has completed a major share buyback, turning inventory into cash, paying back their 6% LT debt early and attracting a major activist (sup RC? Youƒ??ve been quiet lately). 

How come there were no ƒ??newsƒ? about this? Is everyone sleeping? How come Bank of America has had a price target of $2 for GameStop (sorry, BofA increase their PT to $10 today) for months? And by the way, what has FUNDAMENTALLY changed for BofA to increase 5 fold their valuation of GameStop? What a bunch or crooks.

You wanna know whatƒ??s not irrational?

- GME has $7b in sales in the end of a console cycle and amidst lockdowns. 

- Out of those sales +1b is e-commerce that is growing 300% YoY

-+ 50m power up members (amazon prime has 150m members)

- an established and functioning sales and distribution network worldwide

- a healthy balance sheet. 

All that while operating in an industry with a crazy TAM, with growth rates above 30% and with THE MOST DESIRABLE demographic. 


And seriously, a 3x EV/sales is a bubble for this? The e-commerce part of it alone should trade at this valuation. And letƒ??s not forget that the only reason GME has not sold more in Q3 is because there is a shortage of product! Demand is not gonna evaporate. So discount that valuation to this year sales and you have a &lt;1.5x time Sales/EV valuation.


So ask yourself one question:

Would you pay an +80% interest to remain short in this thesis?

12913,Sell,GME,,556YEETO,lb8hjc,1357,10271,"# The GME SEC Data and Hedge Fund Shitfuckery: A Deep Dive

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&amp;#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either ƒ?? if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure ƒ?? when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream ƒ?? GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the ""surface level"" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been ""laundered,"" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

(Extremely important data for Counterfeit Stock theories) # The GME SEC Data and Hedge Fund Shitfuckery: A Deep Dive

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&amp;#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either ƒ?? if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure ƒ?? when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

https://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream ƒ?? GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

 I'm going to Morocco at the end of July. I promised my girlfriend I wouldn't spend more money on stocks. But... I'm thinking of spending all the money I set side for the holiday  with my girlfriend on BBBY Calls and shares.  


I'm considering spending all my money on this cheap deep value stock.

Sales a down over the past year. Sounds like a company going broke.

Then what about inside ownership? Insider ownership is at 13 %.  
That's weird right? 104% ownership of the total outstanding shares by institutions and insiders.   


**Shorts:**  
Yes, how about shorts? Well.. here it also gets kind of messy. There was a 90% short percentage of the float a few months back. That all of a sudden it changed to 30% without the price moving up.

a few  days back FINRA reported a 89% short percentage of the float: credit for picture to u/sixsringsuperfly

In the world of corporate law, **""big law"" firms run the scene**. They are the ones responsible for nearly every single SPAC deal, merger, etc. that you read about on the financial news. Arguably, about 100 of these ""big law"" firms run the corporate scene in America, with other scattered mid-size firms working on big deals here and there.

One of the biggest stressors in dealing with big law firms is **billing rates.** In the world of big law, we bill clients every 1/10th of an hour (every 6 minutes). Firms like K&amp;E bill at a **rate of $1,845 per hour** (by partner), with associates billing at rates like **$400-$800+ per hour**.

 Form documents (think along the lines of 100-page merger agmnt) are worked on by corporate lawyers for hours on end, which is why you see people, like me, billing absurd hours at absurd rates. Doing basic DD, document review, contract editing, and more, will all earn clients huge bills for seemingly menial tasks. **Big law firms have been trying to find a way to outsource work that their clients increasingly don't want to pay for.** Law firms are outsourcing to India to conduct document review. Lawyers and businesses alike have been trying to solve this issue for years.

**Akin Gump's ""RegSpot"" launch is likely made in response to these billing pressures.** It's not quite clear what kind of work in particular this is aiming to accomplish, but it's meant to deal with things like due diligence, conflict checks, other legal work at increasingly high speed/a short amount of time. Time is everything in corporate law, and Palantir's Foundry is here to tackle it. Foundry is literally taking on the entire essence of big law billing by offering a solution to get the work done faster. Endless value add to clients. If other big law firms follow suit and this becomes an industry norm, I don't even know what the limit is. I can see peer firms subscribing to Foundry because firms that don't use it will be stuck billing clients with vast amounts of hours.

This can literally revolutionize the legal industry and disrupt billing norms as we see it. Maybe Palantir will fuck my job. That's fine, because PLTR TO THE MOON.

&amp;#x200B;

We had this event where RC sold his shares to $BBBY and media along with all the bitches like SEC. Hedgies , used their power and immediately without any information called it a classic sale and take the profit and adios amigos. Without any research, without any information, they just took the headline and dropped the stock prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I believe in RC and in his cleverness and his steps, since I have also been in GME for over a year and a half. Of course, even though I am down 80% of my position on $BBBY, I remain calm and will buy more this week because I know that this is all just a fabricated bullshit situation from the media and hedgies.

&amp;#x200B;

To get back to the point of this post. Once again we witness the strength of our group. Not for the reason that we manipulated shares, because we don't do that, but for the reason that immediately after they manipulated the price and the media, it showed us again and a huge amount of FUD started to spread everywhere, so a group of retail investors sat down at the table and did another great research.

&amp;#x200B;

The strength of wallstreetbets is that since Friday, several incredible DDs have appeared here again, which are supported by facts and no nonsense and media reports that even hedgies have to puzzle over what all of us can really do.

I would like to thank everyone who is involved in sharing information and hard work here. Don't forget to BUY and HODL. Have a nice rest of the weekend

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, I believe this approach is repeatable, and normally I wouldn't be so interested in making money, but knowing who it is at the expense of has piqued my interest a bit more than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

This can be a scientific method to expropriate wealth from the worst kinds of rich people, and.. well, I do like that very much indeed, so I wanted to share my analysis of this success.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Freedom of decision and debate:

The targeting of GME shorts was a collaborative effort from the /r/WSB mass line. There was not a single centralized voice of authority that identified and mandated that $GME shorts should be targeted with a squeeze. Users smarter than me identified the weakness of the short positions, and a consensus organically emerged among users as the information was processed.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Unity of action:

If one consensus clearly emerges, all members are expected to follow the party line and not deviate from the consensus, or continue propagandizing against it. Instead, they are committed to the decision made by a supermajority of other users.

The solidarity from subreddit users has been impressive. Hundreds of posts encouraging users to not sell and to buy more has forced the shorts into an irretrievable position. They have no choice now but to lose everything, despite coordinated efforts from their partners in the brokerages. We won, not because we had a perfect strategy or decision-making organization, but because we were unified in our action. This is the most important point. We individuals have less money and thereby less market power than the hedge funds. Obviously, the only way we are stronger than the funds is if we are committed to unity of action, even if we weren't the ones who were originally wanting to target GME shorts. I wasn't involved until later in the game, but even I bought in, because I wanted to be part of something greater than myself. Of course, not every single retail investor who bought GME made money, but on the net, the hedge fund lost billions that will be divvied up among the short squeezers.

&amp;#x200B;

3) General organization:  
This was actually the weakest point in the chain and the greatest area that can be improved. A subreddit with 300 new low-quality posts a minute is not quite the best way to arrive at a consensus. I think better voting and discussion systems may be in order to improve this.

&amp;#x200B;

This is me trying to take advantage of the political to make money. This is not me trying to make a political post about which candidate you should support or which economic policy I want in my country. It's simply me talking about applying a method for better organizing the practice of Buying Stocks I Like.

&amp;#x200B;

The principle of democratic centralism (which is a Leninist idea) is very applicable to organizing future short squeezes.

18018,Buy,CLOV,,UnfazedSynergy,n3bqnw,58,305,"Hello my fellow apes, before I start, I wanted to say thank you so much for the love and support on my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1so1m/quick_ta_dd_on_clov_as_of_42921/)! I didn't know that it would garner that much of positive feedbacks and I'm excited to write my TA posts as a series if time allows me to.

With that being said, I do not plan to write these kind of posts for every trading session days since I would run out of things to say at one point. My intention is to write these kind of posts for days where we see a significant gap-up or gap-down that reinforces the Elliott Wave Theory speculation. I also want to remind you that if the closing price goes below the speculated ""bottom"", the entire theory will be invalidated. I hope you all join me in this bumpy ride and enjoy it together. Anyways, let's get right to what I think about Friday's (4/30/21) price action.

# Brief Summary:

As of 4/30/21, CLOV opened at $9.89 and closed at $9.85 with a previous closing price of $10.17 (-3.15%). To simply put it, today was a consolidation day based on the opening price and the closing price. The volume didn't help with the stock's bullish sentiment either as Friday's volume was at 17.38 mil in contrast to Thursday's volume at 68.33 mil. This means Friday's volume was cut down by more than -74.5%; that's 3/4 of Thursday's total volume, gone for today. Now, I have a few speculations as to why we experienced one of the lowest volumes on Friday ever since the CLOV hype began:

* Continual market beatdown against smaller market caps causing a FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) against retail investors which discouraged investors from purchasing stocks due to the fear of further market beatdown.
* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.
   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting ""dumped on"" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.

**Fibonacci retracements:**

With Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Friday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.

&amp;#x200B;

# Friday's (5 min) Chart:

[Friday's \(5 min\) chart](https://preview.redd.it/77zk7810uqw61.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aee8685305104aea32ca0c18b808d01ecb4c23ac)

**VWAP:**

Today, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**

Based on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.

**RSI:**

This is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high.

**Short Volume:**

Let's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?

It's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4/19 to 4/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are ""dumping"" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.

That being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!

**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**

* CLOV's chart on Friday EXACTLY mirrored the NASDAQ 100 chart and NASDAQ's relative volume was the LOWEST out of all three major stock market indices (DOW, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500). Don't believe it? Check out the images below.
   * Based on the images below, it's clear to me that there is a positive correlation to the performance of market index versus CLOV (individual stock) on Friday. This leads to a reasonable assumption that CLOV had a disappointing day NOT because of CLOV's getting ""dumped on"" per se, but rather because the entire market (especially NASDAQ) performed poorly on Friday.

**Fibonacci retracements:**

With Friday's bearish price action, it's good to see that we've respected the 23.6% level as a major support rather than letting it become the new resistance level. However, Friday's price action doesn't **necessarily** indicate that Thursday's (4/29/21) price action was a bear trap. Depending on the next Monday's overall market performance, volume level, and buying pressure, I think we will be able to get a clearer picture as to whether we are going to use 23.6% level as a support to bounce off from or continue the downward trend. Overall, I do think that we will see 23.6% level being used as a support for CLOV to bounce off on as long as the overall market shows a reversal pattern on Monday.

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Friday's price action, although it was a minimal dip in the grand scheme of things, does confirm that we are in wave 2 which is a corrective wave. I originally speculated that we will see a healthy pullback to around $8.52 range but since the chart respected the 23.6% level as a support, we may see a bounce earlier and perhaps move on to wave 3. That's a very good thing for all of us who want to see CLOV explode off to Mars. But, of course, this is all contingent upon high volume level and high buying pressure. We will have to continue to observe the price action and the daily chart to find further confirmations that indicate to wave 3 speculation.

# Friday's (5 min) Chart:

[Friday's \(5 min\) chart](https://preview.redd.it/77zk7810uqw61.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aee8685305104aea32ca0c18b808d01ecb4c23ac)

**VWAP:**

Today, I wanted to focus more on the VWAP which is an acronym for 'volume weighted average price'. Simply put, it's a metric used for intraday charts to determine the buying pressure and selling pressure based on that day's volume and share price. The rule of this metric is: **If the candle sticks are above the VWAP line, it's a bullish sentiment and vice versa.**

Based on that rule, we can now look at the 5 min chart and see what's going on with the VWAP line which is colored blue. Looking at the chart, we can see that during the market opening, we stayed **above** the VWAP line with a great start to the volume level. This means that the buying pressure was greater than the selling pressure based on the volume. However, as the trading session went on, the explanation provided from the brief summary section caused the volume level to dry up and die off. And as the volume level went down, you can see how the candle sticks moved **below** the VWAP line which means that the selling pressure was greater than the buying pressure.

**RSI:**

This is further reinforced by looking at Friday's RSI chart. You can see that during the market opening, RSI trended towards an overbought territory, but as volume level died off RSI eventually corrected itself down to a neutral level, consolidated a bit, and headed over to an oversold level which is correlated to the 5 min price chart above. Based on VWAP and RSI analysis, it is reasonable to assume that CLOV will show a reversal as long as the volume level is high.

# Short Interest:

**Short Volume:**

Let's take a look at CLOV's short volume as a bonus since people believe there's a potential for short squeeze. According to a quick Google search, it is widely accepted as a fact that 10% short interest ratio is considered 'high' while 20% short interest ratio is considered 'extremely high'. Now take a look at all three of the short volume data on popular stocks like AMC, GME, and then CLOV. And now, take a look at CLOV's stock price history chart with its volume for each trading session days, what do you see?

It's clear to me as day that shorts are shorting in PROPORTION to the amount of volume level for each trading session day. Whether that day's volume level is extremely high or not, they are shorting CLOV with an average shorting ratio percentage of 23.1% which is considered EXTREMELY HIGH from 4/19 to 4/30. To further add, we can see that short volume ratio is pretty much similar across all three stocks. Based on that analysis, I will let you be the judge on whether we have a potential for short squeeze or not.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, CLOV's share price did NOT necessarily drop on Friday because people are ""dumping"" their shares. We rather saw a slight drop in CLOV's share price on Friday because of market's poor overall performance that led to an extremely low volume level. This led to shorts having a field day by shorting the stock even more as the short volume ratio is consistently at around 20%. **But,** we shouldn't invest in the stock based on the short squeeze potential alone. We should invest in the stock because we believe in the company and the company's management.

That being said, with 2 days of bearish days for the overall market, I hope to see a green day for the market on Monday and see CLOV bounce off from the $9.66 support. Thank you for reading and I look forward to throwing a champagne party with you all once we are at the moon!

**Tl;dr:** **Today's low volume can be explained by the overall market performance, so don't worry too much about the price action today. BUY and HODL and watch this four petal leaf company go off to the moon with me.**

Ok, before I retire to my weekend, I have to let you know why I do believe this battle can be won by us only one way and why there is right now more likelihood short sellers can win. 

You know that the Short interest ratio has not changed much and it is still above 100%. And you also know probably borrowing rate for short sellers is &gt;30% per annum, meaning you short 100$, if you keep it for 1 year, you will pay the lender &gt;30$ in interest.

Ok, we have to remember this! Not the same short-sellers might stay in this game forever. Some get in, they get hurt, they get out, someone else takes the rein, meaning not one single hedge fund will pay &gt;30% rate per annum on fees.  They believe this will blow over very soon 1-2 months max, they will pay 5-6% on that shorted stocks but if GME goes down, they will probably make 50-60 maybe 90%. If GME goes up to 600$ they will short at that price, if it foes to 800$ they will short at that, overall one day they believe (and that day they believe is not 1 year but few months ahead, they will make a ton of money). Therefore, you see SHort interest has not changed much, some have covered, but others have stepped in, believing that the current price is too high, they can make money at this level. 

 They believe this is a beautiful asymmetric risk and reward trade based on historical short squeezes. take the example of VW. Google it. 

TAKEAWAY and ONLY WAY TO SQUEEZE:  ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY SQUEEZE THEM OUT IS TO HOLD THIS STOCK FOR MONTHS TO COME, NOT 1 or 2 months but maybe 1 YEAR! The only way to bleed them out is to make sure they are shorted for the long term, they pay borrowing rates, and also, REMEMBER, every quarter they have to send letters to their CLIENTS explaining how their portfolio did. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS for FEW QUARTERS so that when their investors see their performance, they will either pull the money out or force them to cover! THIS IS LONG TERM GAME guys.

* Canada's cannabis market is expected to grow twice as fast as the U.S. market between 2020 and 2021 and almost three times faster from 2021 to 2022
* Tilray is well positioned with strong edible, vape, and beverage brands as users steadily switch to cannabis 2.0 products
* Canadian black market is nearly the same size as the legal market, however it is steadily declining which adds TAM for LPƒ??s

Europe:

* EU GDP = $15 Trillion
* Population = 600 Million
* GMP certified grow facility in Portugal can export anywhere in EU 
* Dominant position in Germany with CC Pharma distribution network (access to 13,000 pharmacies)
* European cannabis market to be worth $3.8 Billion USD by 2025, growing at a 67.4% CAGR

United States:

* CBD market growing at a CAGR of 42%, expected to reach $13 Billion by 2024
* Manitoba Harvest sells CBD and Hemp products throughout the U.S. in grocery stores and online (Amazon)
* SweetWater Brewery sells cannabis themed alcohol nationally in 29,000+ grocery stores. Upon legalization they can begin crafting and distributing CBD and THC products using their distribution network.
* Tilray does NOT currently sell ANY THC products in the U.S. because they would be at risk of losing their Nasdaq listing.
   * SAFE Banking (bipartisan support) can potentially change this and allow them to execute an M&amp;A deal with an MSO as well as allow them to begin producing and selling THC products inside the U.S. (Can NOT export cannabis from Canada)

Analysts are wrong:

* This graph shows the average price target, and Tilray stock price
* One obvious pattern is that Tilray is bullish when it is above the average analyst target.
* 2 years ago the average price target was 40-80, and now the fundamentals are better than ever, and analysts only expect the share price to reach 22

My Technical Analysis:

* The first Fibonacci level of interest for a retracement of the move from 300 to 2 is the .382 level which has a price of 116, hence the 116 price target.
* This lines up perfectly with my Elliot Wave analysis which has a projection for a new wave higher into the Fib level

**Summary:**

Tilray is the dominant player in two high growth international markets that are expected to grow much faster than the U.S. providing 25-35% sales CAGR over the next 2+ years. EPS is expected to turn positive in the next 1-2 Years, Sales are projected to be over $1 Billion by 2022. Despite being the largest player in Canada by market share, Tilray trades at a price/sales ratio of 13 while competitors Sundial, Cronos and CGC trade at 38, 59 and 20 PS respectively.

21769,Buy,TSLA,,ElectricPance,otwk5v,218,199,"Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.

Listen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple.  I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap. 

&amp;#x200B;

**PE Ratio**

The PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings. 

For a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&amp;P is something like 15. 

We have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter. 

Now the PE ratio is lower, but still very high. 

TSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2. 

So 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110. 

(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)

Another way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year. 

$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \~135

This is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 ""per car"". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average. 

**Future**

Does anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?

Of course not.

With Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year.  So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year. 

3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings. 

How about with $8,000 per car?

=$24Billion

$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap

How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock. 

$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's try that again for 2028

Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors. 

This gives an annual earnings of $72B. 

&amp;#x200B;

((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc. 

\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost. 

$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit. 

\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))

&amp;#x200B;

**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**

This would be a stock price around $2200 per share. 

If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Notes**

It is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \~ $2T. 

&amp;#x200B;

*ƒ??If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.ƒ? - Sun Tzu*

***The advantages Hedge Funds have in the battle for the GME Short Squeeze:***

&amp;nbsp;


**Information advantage**

- The hedge funds will always have quicker, better access to information than all of WSB. 

**Coordination advantage**

- They are one big organized entity, and can move their entire ƒ??Armyƒ? of bets with infinitesimal speed. 

**Size advantage**

- The hedges have more money at stake and in play than all of WSB put together.

**Ally advantage**

- They have powerful collaborators. The media, who doesnƒ??t want a hedge fund to go bust. You can assume, the US government (and every other government), because they donƒ??t want a stock market crash. And everyone who colludes with hedge funds, i.e. all of corporate America.

**Propaganda advantage**

- Whether it be social media posts, bots, articles in mainstream media, they have enough money to blast out as much fake statistics and propaganda as they like. WSB does not.
 
**Mathematical advantage**

- A lot of trading has become complicated math. You can assume that every single analyst they have/need is working on the math to get them out of the hole they have dug themselves in. We are less good at math.

**Speed &amp; Precision advantage**

- They can make trades and bets much faster, with a much higher precision than WSB.

**Strategic advantage**

- You can assume the hedge funds know your position, but you donƒ??t know theirs. This in my mind is the most powerful of all advantages for them. Imagine you are playing chess against an opponent and have to decide which pieces to move, but arenƒ??t allowed to see where theirs are? But they can ever *read your thoughts* (i.e. this forum).

**Legal advantage**

- Given the very very light penalties even for something patently illegal in financial manipulations, it is in their very interest to do anything whose cost is ƒ??cheaperƒ? than the potential cost of the actual monetary loss, whether it be legal or not. If you were the CEO/Fund manager, you too would decide for illegality.

&amp;nbsp;


So, the question then becomes, given this situation, in which for the hedge funds not only billions are at stake, but the narrative of their ability to make the market, and the propaganda of expertise they disseminate, how does WSB win and force the Short Squeeze? What are WSB's advantages? How do you make best use of them? Who are WSB's allies? How can they be activated? How do you deceive the enemy? How do you overwhelm them, tactically?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

A few initial thoughts on counter-strategies (Feel free to suggest more, and I'll add them in):

- The strongest narrative that might influence public/politics is that the stock market is a casino, and the house is not just taking its fees, but cheating. The stock market is no longer a ""free market"", but a place where big players make the rules, and use their wealth to make more wealth for themselves.

- WSB needs to find and activate allies. These might be the company itself (GME), value investors who believe in the free market and its efficiency, political/investment figures who want investment to actually mean something.

- Some disadvantages need to be turned into advantages. For example, it will be difficult to impossible for WSB to move in concert without alerting the ""enemy"" to its own ovements. So, how does one coordinate a move in which transparency becomes an advantage?

Well it Thursday night and GME just had it itƒ??s first down day in quite some time. All you new traders are probably down 50% shaking in your boots. Alas the institutions have tried to fuck and yet they are still about to get shafted. 

Whatƒ??s happened today? the price was manipulated we suffered a short ladder attack and brokerages banned buying of shares. Even after all this less than 2 million shares were sold by you retards and you held. Safe to say Iƒ??m proud of you. Your faith will be rewarded.

Whatƒ??s going to happen tomorrow? Friday morning I expect premarket to rise and price to skyrocket following open. The reason for this is mainly pent up demand since no retail could buy today. There is also the factor of mass 0DTE options likely to be purchased, this will cause a gamma squeeze if it happens. This in addition to all the other formerly far OTM will be in the money tomorrow and Dealers will not be able to hedge fast enough. This will result in a gamma squeeze that I believe the magnitude of will put the stock 600+ easy tomorrow. If shorts cover it could be much higher, but either way we should have a good setup for Squeeze on Monday. 

Although there is a possibility in a desperate attempt to save their asses people will do anything to drive the price down. Some people would see jail as better then what they risk losing if GME breaks 600. Yesterday no one would have thought that Apex would stop letting people buy GME, but here we are be ever vigilant.

However if the cross occurs that means we have good momentum going.

We broke resistance at 13.95 and we are slightly above  13.95 , if we close above that resistance level I would set my target tomorrow at $15 .

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.

In this post, Iƒ??ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. Iƒ??ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. 

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I donƒ??t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck ƒ??diamond handingƒ?, Iƒ??m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how Iƒ??m trading GME.

These three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**

# History of shares and shorts on $GME

Hereƒ??s some history on GME thatƒ??s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. 

* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GMEƒ??s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)

* **GME used to be in the S&amp;P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **Itƒ??s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&amp;P.** 
* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img axl9ipwqw2i61...*

* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772

* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  
* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. 
* **There are many strange connections between DTCCƒ??s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhoodƒ??s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhoodƒ??s users had GME. 
   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.
   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a ƒ??turn off buying or elseƒ? kind of arrangement. 
   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesnƒ??t care about shooting down Robinhood. Itƒ??s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. 
   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it 
      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, youƒ??d know something interesting.** 

# Why GME went up

* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. 
   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When thereƒ??s **high trading volume relative to total float**, itƒ??s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. 
   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) 
   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: 
      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was
      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more
      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them
      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME 
   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. Thatƒ??s why GME shot up. 

# The Big Reset

This wasnƒ??t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. 

* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). Itƒ??s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. 
* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. 

# However, this is not the end for GME

* Everything started with value on GME
   * At $50, weƒ??re back to a value play. GMEƒ??s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)
   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, weƒ??re not too far off from that right now. 
   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink 
* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) 
   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. Heƒ??s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that heƒ??s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. 
      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohenƒ??s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. 
   * **Regulatory involvement.** Itƒ??s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. 
   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think itƒ??s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. 
   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didnƒ??t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. 
      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhoodƒ??s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on ƒ??downgradeƒ? under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** 

# How Iƒ??m thinking about GME now 

This is going to sound extremely strange, but **Iƒ??ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I canƒ??t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadnƒ??t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but Iƒ??m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. 

None of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of ƒ??GME is another blockbuster destined for deathƒ? is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. 

Since part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). 

I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I donƒ??t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** 

That being said, Iƒ??m hoping for a further dip. Iƒ??m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. 

# Suggestions 

This is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. 

Hereƒ??s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. 

* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **thatƒ??s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So Iƒ??m selling calls against my remaining shares. 
   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that donƒ??t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of ƒ??pennies in front of a steamrollerƒ? but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**
      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). 
      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. 
      * Two scenarios:
      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that ƒ??canƒ??t go tits upƒ?.
      * ƒ??Downsideƒ? risks:
* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - donƒ??t fomo. 
* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME itƒ??s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesnƒ??t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if youƒ??re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and donƒ??t pay you for it, margin call you when youƒ??re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I donƒ??t think the ƒ??freeƒ? commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.
* **Minimize regret; donƒ??t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares ƒ??earlyƒ? on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for ƒ??maximum profitƒ? led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.
* **Donƒ??t bet more than you can afford to lose.** Iƒ??ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. Iƒ??ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** Itƒ??s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If youƒ??ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Donƒ??t sell on dips.** Youƒ??re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when itƒ??s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. Iƒ??m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.

# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?

On February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions Iƒ??d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. 

## Dear Vlad,

1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?

2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?

3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?

4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME

5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GMEƒ??s price rise again to $500/share or more? 

## Dear Kenny G,

1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?

2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?

3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?

4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?

5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME

6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?

## Dear Plumpkin,

1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity

2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back

3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt

4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th

5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital

6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?

7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?

8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME

9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise

10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-""R""-T when they closed their short gme positions

11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?

12) Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to  buy-to-close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO / fails to deliver?","GME - EndGame part 6: The Big Reset, or The Greatest Financial Crime of the Century - and how to play GME going forward",44244.46723,t3_lm0s6v,"GME - EndGame part 6: The Big Reset, or The Greatest Financial Crime of the Century - and how to play GME going forward  

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.

In this post, Iƒ??ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. Iƒ??ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. 

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I donƒ??t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck ƒ??diamond handingƒ?, Iƒ??m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how Iƒ??m trading GME.

That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that **not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place ƒ?? but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms**, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.ƒ?
   * ƒ??Who controls the DTCC? **The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCCƒ??s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors.ƒ?**

# History of shares and shorts on $GME

Hereƒ??s some history on GME thatƒ??s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. 

* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GMEƒ??s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)

* **GME used to be in the S&amp;P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **Itƒ??s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&amp;P.** 
* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img axl9ipwqw2i61...*

* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?

* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  
* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. 
* **There are many strange connections between DTCCƒ??s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhoodƒ??s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhoodƒ??s users had GME. 
   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.
   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a ƒ??turn off buying or elseƒ? kind of arrangement. 
   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesnƒ??t care about shooting down Robinhood. Itƒ??s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. 
   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it 
      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, youƒ??d know something interesting.** 

# Why GME went up

* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. 
   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When thereƒ??s **high trading volume relative to total float**, itƒ??s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. 
   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) 
   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: 
      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was
      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more
      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them
      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME 
   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. Thatƒ??s why GME shot up. 

# The Big Reset

This wasnƒ??t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. 

* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). Itƒ??s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. 
* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. 

# However, this is not the end for GME

* Everything started with value on GME
   * At $50, weƒ??re back to a value play. GMEƒ??s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)
   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, weƒ??re not too far off from that right now. 
   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink 
* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) 
   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. Heƒ??s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that heƒ??s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. 
      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohenƒ??s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. 
   * **Regulatory involvement.** Itƒ??s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. 
   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think itƒ??s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. 
   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didnƒ??t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. 
      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhoodƒ??s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on ƒ??downgradeƒ? under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** 

# How Iƒ??m thinking about GME now 

This is going to sound extremely strange, but **Iƒ??ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I canƒ??t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadnƒ??t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but Iƒ??m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. 

None of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of ƒ??GME is another blockbuster destined for deathƒ? is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. 

Since part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). 

I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I donƒ??t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** 

That being said, Iƒ??m hoping for a further dip. Iƒ??m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. 

# Suggestions 

This is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. 

Hereƒ??s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. 

* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **thatƒ??s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So Iƒ??m selling calls against my remaining shares. 
   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that donƒ??t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of ƒ??pennies in front of a steamrollerƒ? but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**
      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). 
      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. 
      * Two scenarios:
      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that ƒ??canƒ??t go tits upƒ?.
      * ƒ??Downsideƒ? risks:
* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - donƒ??t fomo. 
* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME itƒ??s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesnƒ??t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if youƒ??re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and donƒ??t pay you for it, margin call you when youƒ??re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I donƒ??t think the ƒ??freeƒ? commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.
* **Minimize regret; donƒ??t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares ƒ??earlyƒ? on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for ƒ??maximum profitƒ? led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.
* **Donƒ??t bet more than you can afford to lose.** Iƒ??ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. Iƒ??ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** Itƒ??s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If youƒ??ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Donƒ??t sell on dips.** Youƒ??re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when itƒ??s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. Iƒ??m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.

# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?

On February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions Iƒ??d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. 

## Dear Vlad,

1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?

2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?

3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?

4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME

5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GMEƒ??s price rise again to $500/share or more? 

## Dear Kenny G,

1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?

2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?

3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?

Pigs ??? starring as Hedge Funds,

Bananas ??? starring as GME shares, and

Monkeys ??? starring as *YOU*, the casual retail investors!

# What is a Short?

Before understanding what a Short Squeeze is, you need to understand what shorting a stock means.

There is a Lion ??? that owns all of the bananas ??? in the jungle. He sells some of these bananas ??? to Monkeys ???.  There is a Pig ??? named Melvin that thinks the bananas ??? are overpriced right now and expects the price to drop next week. So Melvin the Pig ??? asks Lion ??? if he can borrow some bananas ??? and agrees to return them later. Melvin the Pig ??? then sells the bananas ??? he just borrowed and plans to buy back those bananas ??? next week for cheap after the price has dropped. He can then return the bananas ??? to Lion ??? and keep the profit he just made from selling the bananas ??? for more than he bought them back for. Melvin the Pig ??? just *shorted* the bananas ???.

# So what is happening now?

Melvin the Pig ??? borrowed A LOT of bananas ??? and sold them all thinking he could buy them back for pennies later. But the price went up, *way up*! Melvin the Pig ??? is in some ???? because he still needs to buy back all those bananas ??? he borrowed and sold so he can return them to the Lion ???. The problem for Melvin ??? is that a bunch of Monkeys ??? have decided to buy all the bananas ??? they can and they refuse to sell them back. The bigger problem for Melvin ??? is when he does start buying back the bananas ??? from the Monkeys ???, his large amount of demand with the small amount of supply will drive the price up *even more*! ???? ???? ???? And it'll go up *quick* too. This sudden surge in demand and price is the *short squeeze*.

# So when will the short squeeze happen?

Nobody knows exactly when. There's no expiration date that Lion ??? and Pig ??? agreed to when Pig ??? borrowed the bananas ??? from Lion ???. ""So Pig ??? could just wait forever??"" No you big dummy, you'll get your tendies soon. There are 2 situations that could set off the short squeeze. First, Melvin the Pig ??? agreed to pay Lion ??? a Fee every day he doesn't return the bananas ???. This daily fee is keeping constant pressure on Pig ??? to go ahead and buy back all the bananas ??? he owes Lion ???. Second, Lion ??? can demand Pig ??? returns the bananas ???, and if Lion ??? does this, then Pig ??? would only have a couple of days to comply. This could happen Monday, this could happen in a week, this could happen in a month. Nobody knows exactly when.

# So what do I need to do?

HOLD onto your bananas ???, you Monkey ???! That is literally all you have to do. Hold on with your ????????! My cousin doesn't even have hands and even she can hold onto a banana ??? with her nubs. Right now the Pig ??? is trying to wait us out, paying his daily Fee to the Lion ???, hoping you Monkeys ??? get tired of holding your bananas ??? so he can buy them back for cheaper and return them to Lion ???. Pig ??? doesn't just want our bananas ???, he NEEDS our bananas ???. If we just keep HOLDING our bananas ???, the short squeeze is inevitable. Understand this, this is important! HOLDING decreases supply, which increases price. The higher the price gets, the bigger the daily fee Pig ??? has to pay gets, and the more likely Lion ??? is to demand Pig ??? return all his borrowed shares. HOLDING not only increases the price of your banana ???, but the more Monkeys ??? that hold, the sooner the short squeeze will get here!

# What if the price starts dropping, should I be nervous the short squeeze won't happen? I'm scared!

The short squeeze is inevitable if all you Monkeys ??? just keep holding. In the meantime, the Pigs ??? are going to use every strategy they can to try to scare you into selling your bananas ???. You may have heard the term ""Ladder Attack"" lately. In that case, while you ???, Melvin ???, and his buddy Steve the Rat ??? are standing around the Walnut Tree, Steve ??? will say, very loudly to make sure you can hear it, ""Hey Melvin ???, do you want to buy this banana ??? for $150? I don't want it."" Melvin ??? will buy it for $150, and then a few minutes later say, very loudly to make sure you can hear it, ""Hey Steve ???, do you want to buy this banana ??? for $100? I don't want it."" Steve ??? will buy it for $100. They are trying to trick you ??? into thinking your banana is only worth $100 now, but it's not!!!! Do not panic sell your banana ???! That is what they are trying to get you to do. Remember, the short squeeze is inevitable if we just what? HOLD! The Pigs ??? may also pay their buddy Cramer the Snake ?? to go on television and say ""The Pigs ??? have returned all their bananas ??? to the Lion ???!"" Do not believe the Snake ??.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

[http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf](http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf)

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

I'm all for loss porn, but guys please don't go all Kony 2012 hypetrain on me.

Glacier Capital exists. That sentence isn't going to make me any friends, but your wallet needs to hear it. They've even written some insightful pieces which panned out as per the analyses; CVNA (link below) performed well in the short-term as predicted, but the majority shareholder and CEO sold practically all of his shares four days ago, al in line with their poor long-term outlook.

[http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf](http://glaciercapital.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/This-Time-is-not-Different-LP-August-2019.pdf)

A lot of the theorising focuses on the founding year of the company. Look... the profile on Bloomberg is for a different Glacier Capital LLC. There appear to be quite a few Glacier Capital LLCs. In the US, LLC names are not unique on a federal level. Unrelated companies in different states can have exactly the same name.

When we consider that the CEO of *the* Glacier Capital was still a university student in 2005, we can safely conclude this isn't a smoking gun and it's likely we're tripping up over unrelated companies.

What does this mean for the short. Is it a bluff? Are billionaires phoning each other and bribing journos to falsify the existence of hedge funds? Idk, I'm just a sleep-deprived dickhead on stimmies who is concerned that someone on his second sunrise in one sleep cycle is exercising more calm and reason than people with 100x my net worth.

But go on, let's have a crack at this.

Look at the dates. When the whole GME surge was first kicking off, Glacier Capital filed to register for a 'Legal Entity Identifier' (LEI) in order to comply with 'Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II' (MiFID II), which was a tightening of regulations within the EU in 2008. LEIs are required in order to comply with MiFID II, and MiFID II needs to be complied with in order to carry out certain high risk activities, including forms/scales of derivatives.

I am not a European financial services lawyer but considering the timing of everything, it seems reasonable to assume that the short positions may be real - and if new certs were put in place just for one series of positions, then it isn't crazy to think they might be especially large.

Again, *I am not saying* that this isn't an incestuous industry or that the capital isn't coming from known players. I am specifically begging you not to be a fucking dumbfuck because of one Reddit-cum-Sherlock post so that whatever dumbass decision you make next is at least a little less erratic.

Hey fellow retards, I just wanted flag this great post by [u/MarioBuzo](https://www.reddit.com/u/MarioBuzo/) and offer a high-level version for those in the trenches. Basically, you're not only fighting the shorts, but the media (surprise!), the DTCC and its clearing agents while the regulatory bodies remain indifferent (complicit?). As always, assume what you will. Synopsis post below.

1. First, the shorts work with the banks to create fraudulent shares to drive the price down. This was most likely the cause of Thursdayƒ??s dip in GMEƒ??s shares. The HFs and the bank literally trade the same shares back and forth with each other to drive the price down in larger volumes than the buy orders and then never deliver the shares because they never own them in the first place. This technique is known as ƒ??strategic fails-to-deliverƒ? and is basically given a pass by the SEC.
2. Next, the shorts work with the usual media suspects and research analysts to push their lies.
3. Third, the DTCC, which is the central repository for all shares and owned by the brokerages, allows the creation of billions of counterfeit shares through a process called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) that never even make it to the SEC. This is where everything gets very murky. Naturally, the DTCC has resisted every effort at transparency.
4. Fourth, brokerages pull margin from customers causing a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Anyone seen that recently?)

The short's playbook today is the same as its always been. Only it never accounted for a WSB rebellion.

I highly suggest reading the articles because Iƒ??m only skimming the surface of how complicated and rigged the entire system is. Not surprisingly the root cause is the sheer amount of money involved for all the players.

Although we can scream ""to the moon"" all day, in the short term, you'd have to acknowledge how much PLTR has jumped since the Thursday scare, even with the price tanking. Before the SOD, it was at $38, nearly a 20% jump up from 5 days ago. And even with the drop, we're in a very strong, Bullish uptrend. On top of that, we've had 5 ascending closes in a row, differed by pretty big figures, it can't keep doing this for forever. So although as a Long, the reasoning is beyond short sighted and retarded for literally a million reasons, you can at least see where they're at in the head.

Plus don't forget, we're still a top tier MM target and you know deep down they're licking their lips for ER. On top of that, don't forget about all the Retail Traders who are doing so also, but haven't cashed in. It's only Wednesday. ER is Pre-MKT Tuesday. That's a whole week to go through. Wdyt think is going to happen when people realize the beast that's soon to come as everyday passes? You believe we'll be below $30 EOW, with the inevitable hype, like those vegetable brained Bears keep preaching?

Hovering around $36 really isn't that bad, it's just back to where we were 2 days ago, that's still huge progress for a week's time. Longs, remain plush. Late bloomers, don't fret. The upward jump will recrudesce once more, back to tranquility lane.

This post represents how god damn retarded we all are- 
and at the same time, 
it shows us how fucking beautiful we all are. 

Wallstreetbets was all some of us had this year 

and WE FUCKING CRUSHED IT. 

I made enough money trading on my fucking cell phone 
to pay for my entire education 
&amp; not need a stupid fucking job 
while I put myself thru school 
YOLOƒ??ing way too much money into meme stocks 
for shits and giggles 
and waking up to 100%+ returns 
ON MY ENTIRE SAVINGS MULTIPLE WEEKS IN A ROW. 

2020. 
The biggest fucking train wreck disaster weƒ??ve ever seen. 
But us retards pulled thru it. 
Some of us changed our fucking lives forever. 

Like me. 

Because of this stupid forum 
and all of you idiots- 
my life has been changed forever 

I fucking love you guys so much

Thru all of this bullshit 
I racked up over $40k profits this year. 

How the fuck does that happen 
I only had $8k to my name. 
What the f..
Idk what Iƒ??m doing.
and now,
PETER SCHIFF FOLLOWS ME ON INSTAGRAM. 

right place at the right time. 
Hereƒ??s my story:

I found you idiots at the beginning of this pandemic. 

Feb 2020
I was Scared, 
Depressed, 
lonely, 
bored 
angry 
everything. 
I had Lost my job. 
I was deemed non-essential. 

I couldnƒ??t get unemployment 
because after I applied 
my account was locked 
for fraud for some reason. 

When I called 
I was told I was trying to fraud the government.  
Today They still wonƒ??t pay me. 
I decide I canƒ??t rely on those assholes.
I stumble onto this Shitshow of a Reddit 
called wallstreetbets. 
where everyone is insulting each other 
but then I realize that ... 
Itƒ??s that we all are retarded. 
Everyone on earth is a dipshit 
and once you realize that - 
life, 
makes more sense. 

Somehow

Anyone you perceive as acting cool- 
is a retard trying too hard. 
We are all the same. 

In March, of 2020:
I start trading options and 
really ramping up my risk. 
Iƒ??m in and out of $AAPL calls 
every 2-3 days 
making $300-700 per week trading 
which is fucking awesome for me. 
I donƒ??t have any way to make money 
and now Iƒ??m deemed not essential 
as a medical device salesman. 

Trading is paying my bills. 
My friends are interested. 

I keep throwing in 100%+ of my account into trades. 
So stupid. 

And by May, 2020 = 
It KEEPS WORKING. 
And we are all encouraging each other 
like maniacs on here lol. 

By June = Iƒ??m up $20,000 on the year.

 And guys I donƒ??t care what you say. I know it is a small profit, 
compared to some of the madness on here but... 
To me. 
Itƒ??s a lot of money. 


Percentage-wise 
Iƒ??m up wayyyyy beyond normal

A whole lot of money and - 
I have no clue any other way to make money. 

I made $18k at work, in 2019, 
because things got rough in business 

and then 2020 pandemic was the nail in my medical sales businessƒ?? coffin. 

And Iƒ??m poor as Dick when the pandemic hit. 
My savings, I had about $8k left. .  
Iƒ??ve never had too much money 
but I work hard. 

And at this point all I can think is that 
I know I cannot give up

And trust me I wanted to give up. 
In February and March I thought Iƒ??d become one of these suicides 
because I became so depressed about the virus 
and my wife was becoming sick. 
She was diagnosed with lupus 
and man I didnƒ??t know how hard life could be. 

I had never been tested like this with so much hardships. 

You know you hear stories about people who have very bad struggles, 
and never think youƒ??ll be like that, 
because you work hard, 
but sometimes - 
a pandemic crushes your income to $00.00
The gov wonƒ??t pay you anything 
and your wife is deemed terminally ill.
And then all of her hair falls out

By May of 2020: 
Id already made my 2019 salary in few months. 
I donƒ??t fully understand what is happening 
but I keep reading. 
I Keep studying at nights. 
Understanding stocks further.
I Keep reading WSB. 
It is working.  
Iƒ??m able to pay my bills 
and rent 
and eat
And put gas in my car
And get coffee in the morning. 
Something Iƒ??d never had spare cash to do really, 
multiple months in a row now
from trading- Iƒ??m able to live better than ever. 

But Iƒ??m up all night studying 
Iƒ??m chomping adderall to push thru the shit because in my mind
I couldnƒ??t go to bed yet
I need to learn I need to take this opportunity. 

Iƒ??d think to myself,
ƒ??This is never going to happen again,ƒ?
So Iƒ??d rationalize staying up till 4:30am 
to catch pre-market opening bell 
and buy 1000 shares pre-market 
and then exit them at 9am. 
Trade options till 3pm 
then crash hard 
because itƒ??s earnings day 
and you canƒ??t miss this Shit.

Iƒ??m not starving because Iƒ??m a trader? 

ƒ??Ok push forward,ƒ? I tell myself. ƒ??You can do this.ƒ?

STAYING MOTIVATED THRU THE DARKNESS. 
my gains were steady until the end of the summer 
when my portfolio Doubled bc of Instagram . 

I thought I had made all the money in the world. 
Over 100% gains. 
Little did I know i was about to 100% the 100%

The most incredible thing happened,

Randomly, one day I smoke a fat fat joint
and put in like 2 hours making a meme video for you tardos 
because Iƒ??m so high... 
Iƒ??ve never done it before. 
My first meme video is born

When I post the video on my Instagram, 
no joke, 
Peter fuckin Schiffƒ??s wife- 
is one of my 23 followers 

(I have had this account for years and am posting constantly on it with ZERO interaction. Maybe 1-3 like per post. Posting 10x per week). 

and then schiffƒ??s wife sends my Instagram to Peter - 
they both shout me out 
and I get over 1000 followers in a week. 

ƒ??Whaaaaaat is happening!?!?ƒ?

I decide to go big. 
If fuckin Schiff is into what Iƒ??m saying. LETS FUCKIN GO. 

I walk into the wallstreet casino (market open)
In early July 2020
&amp; I put everything on fuckn $SLV boyz. 

I had about 40 contracts and over 500 shares

(Once again, I know this position is small, but understand me- This is all the money I have. So it was a true god damn yolo in the purest of forms. Iƒ??m so mother fuckin proud of this trade. It changed my life forever).

By the end of July Iƒ??ve almost doubled my money. 
By Aug5 
You saw what happened to silver. 

Rockets to the moon 
then crashes back to earth

I had made the perfect trade

I bought a pair of silver AirMax 97ƒ??s the day I sold my position. 
To celebrate
bc it was so unreal to me 
to make that kind of money so fast. 

I was up up +$40k on the year. 
$SLV was at $28.50 the day I decided to sell

I Bounce. I sell it all. 
Instead of diamond hands. 
I spin a total 180 on my silver theories about it going to $50/oz
and I sell everything and take all of my profits. 
I got a bad feeling. 
I started reading about JP Morgan 
and I exited the entire position 
while people told me if I hold till December Ill make $150k. 
Because silver canƒ??t fail and itƒ??s definitely going to $50/oz &lt;rolls eyes&gt;

I donƒ??t care what they say. 
This is WAY MORE MONEY than Iƒ??m used to. 

$40k total profit and the year isnƒ??t over - I take it

I sell all my $SLV positions. 

In the following days after I sell- 
$SLV absolutely collapses from $29 to $22

Are. You. Kidding. Me. 

I canƒ??t believe it. 
I did the yolo. 
Again
It worked. 
And I fucking sold at the right time. 

I decide thatƒ??s enough. 
Iƒ??m gonna use this to pay for an education to work in surgical technology. 
I apply and Iƒ??m number 6 on the waiting list to get into class. 
But they say that itƒ??s possible. 
So I wait. ... 
maybe I can really pull off the greatest thing Iƒ??ve ever done 
and get my shit back together. 

I get a call on oct 17th from the school. 

There is a spot. 

Iƒ??m speechless guys. 

Once again, 
I know some will make fun of this career, but... 
itƒ??s essential. 
Pay is awesome for me. 
Iƒ??m not extremely smart 
and I like to work with my hands 
this is an excellent job for me. 

Pandemic made me change my attitude towards work. 
No man is above a job 
and if you have a trade 
you can work with your hands - then you will always have income. 
As long as you have hands. 

And if you have income, you can trade like a retard forever. 

If you can trade, 
you can make $40k on your cell phone 
without a job 
in a pandemic. 

Stand up, 
and scream at the top of your lungs if you feel me on this.  
Is anyone even reading this shit anymore? 

Seriously. 
If you understand what Iƒ??m saying, aka-

If you were fucking BROKE 
and you made more money this year than you ever have in your life- 

Stand up and scream at the top of your lungs. 
Because you are a fucking legend. 
And so am I.  

WE WERE BUILT FOR THIS SHIT. 

So, I drop $25k for school. 
I swap $15k of my profits into physical silver 
bc of tax loophole I found. 
I swap the physical silver to eat 
and live on when I need to now.

And my physical silver I got at $25/oz is worth over $30/oz today. . 
And I still have my original $8k in TDameritrade, 
which Iƒ??ve (to date) turned into about $18,500

I finish school on 09.09.2021
I will have a job that day and income

All of this happened because of WallStreet bets. 

Things were so dark. 
So bad. 
No future. 
I Couldnƒ??t see further than a week into my own future. 
No prospects at all in business but bros... 

I was fucking trading. 

And making money. 
And I canƒ??t believe it. 
I still cannot believe this happened 
and I canƒ??t believe I made all this money following this website and trading the entire year. 

Huge Respect to WSB. 
This place was the light at the end of a dark tunnel. 

Seriously. 
Thank you so much. 
All of you. 
You saved my life. 

Read it out loud:

***WallStreetBets Saved My Life*** 

What a fuckin trip. 
We are immortalized. 
We made history in 2020. 
Merry Fucking Christmas you Retards

~edit 

&lt;&lt;My wife is much better (her hair grew back!!) 
and Iƒ??m having a baby boy this March. 
Iƒ??ll be working as an *essential* surgical technologist by the fall of 2021. &gt;&gt;

I only trade penny stocks now with Max risk of $25 loss. 
Because Iƒ??m an idiot 
and a pussy 
I only will put $100 at risk in any trade - 
and I donƒ??t canƒ??t what anyone says about that. 
because my life is forever changed 
for the better, 
because of this forum.}}}",WallstreetBets Saved My Life,44189.01801,t3_kjb3id,"WallstreetBets Saved My Life This year has been outrageous

Now as any good investor knows, the best time to buy into a business is when they are on the verge of collapse, or at least when the market assumes they will collapse, as the price is often lowest and has a good chance of bouncing back. Which is what seems to be happening here. But lets take a look at the numbers.

The lowest stock price reached was $5. The highest ever was $78. Now assuming the stock will rebound and begin to reach past levels if they declare some business deal or loan to prevent bankruptcy on Wednesday, we should expect stocks to reach $20-$40, which I think is a good mark because that's around half of its' max value.

So if on paper, as a usual stock, we are looking at some really good gains of almost double our investments, how confident are people that the stock will reach in the high 80's or even hundreds?

Here's the deal. TSLA has been wildly fluctuating between about 180 and 380 for most of the past few years as investors swing between being sure Elon is an unstoppable genius and being unsure of his ability to actually make money. The latter seems to be dependent on three factors: Tesla's ability to make cars, maintaining a high margin, and the promise of full self-driving. 

The Tesla factory in Fremont has been steadily increasing production, and the China factory has just begun production. They have stated a target of 500,000 vehicles produced globally in the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020. The Shanghai factory will be able to produce cars much cheaper than the Fremont factory and will help mitigate any tariff issues, making the car cheaper for China, the world's largest auto market. Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020. Also, Musk tweeted that the pickup truck will be unveiled later this year, and supposedly they will begin delivering some semi-trucks next year.

Musk is ""certain"" that Tesla will be ""feature complete"" on full self-driving this year, and that drivers will be able to use full self-driving around the middle of 2020. This seems like a stretch, and he's given dates for this in the past that have come and gone, so, you know, grain of salt.

But, let's be optimistic. Let's ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Letƒ??s imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and theyƒ??re slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins. The solar and battery storage side is pulling in some good money with all those solar roofs and industrial grid solutions that are selling like hotcakes thanks in part to California having an inept power company. Full self-driving still hasnƒ??t hit because Musk was wrong about the timing again, but they have been so aggressive and enough progress has been made that they are the clear leader. Waymo is still fucking around in the desert.

In January 2021, Tesla will be worth, I don't know, $120 Billion. That puts the share price at $666. The new Roadster starts at $200k. But, to get $200k, I need to get more money because taxes. How much do I need? About $350,000. I put my $15,000 into fourteen Jan 2021 calls: four at $350 (yolo) and ten at $440 (YOLO). At $666 per share that gives me $350,000.

This really is a peoples Company, at least until it becomes bigger.

They lost a government contract that everyone expected them to win, so thats why they are shorted. And they deserved that contract and are in court proceedings to win it back, so there is definitely long term value here too, along with it being innovative. It holds a ton of hold value of speculation. 

I'm no stock expert, no numbers guy. Shoot, the only number I know is that it has $200 million cash on hand, so its not in debt.

Seriously. This stock has so much shorts against it and such a small number of shares, any volume can make this skyrocket. But theres so many other fakes, wannabes, bots and spams, its hard to get above it.

First of all, what is Palantir? Palantir is a company that builds digital infrastructure for data-driven operations and decision-making. The software developed is later licensed to companies which then allow them to make data-driven decisions, conduct intricate analysis, and make their operations even more efficient and productive. 

Palantir was founded back in 2003, and they've been working extremely close with agencies and sectors of the US government (examples include security, healthcare, defense, etc.) Palantir is so balls deep in US operations that it's extremely unlikely that any other company besides Palantir is considered for contracts issued by the US government. They're already so established and solid in their industry. 

**So why does this matter?**

PLTR is going to help multiple countries with their software and digital infrastructure to help them track and trace Covid-19 and its variants. They will also be helping countries efficiently issue and distribute the vaccine. PLTR is so established in their sector that no other company will be considered for these valuable contracts. 

Their CEO Alex Karp is also a badass killer CEO who knows what he is doing. This quote from him encapsulates the potential growth PLTR can undergo. 

*""We are the only people solving problems companies won't realize they have until 2030.""* \- Alex Karp

Not only this, but the Canadian government also bought $1.1bn of PLTR shares after their ER. They obviously know that this stock is gonna blow up.

As Palantir grows more and more and expands to more countries (thanks to covid), they will become bigger and bigger and their stock will grow *exponentially*.

**Limit Sell Orders Cannot Exceed 150% Of Last Price:** In other words, some on WSB have suggested setting limit sell orders of $10,000/share but that won't work (unless the price of a share last sold for \~$6,700/share).

**No Plans of Margin Selling Positions But 300% Buffer Now Required:** This likely won't impact users with a portfolio with many holdings but if you use Fidelity and you went all-in on GME (using Margin) and you have $0 in cash reserves as a buffer there is a small chance they could sell some of your position \**if they feel the risk justifies it*.  The gentleman said he does not expect any of this to happen but said technically it was possible.  I did not fully vet the 300% requirement either.

**They Will NOT Lend Shares Held in Cash:** First thing tomorrow you should call them and move any shares you have (that were purchased with Margin) into Cash holdings.  This will not sell anything, this will not create any taxable event, it is simply the way they hold the shares on the ledger.  \**This of course assumes you did not borrow money to buy the shares.*  Example: You have an account with $X value in GME shares and you used ""Margin"" on the buy ticket to avoid any future 48-hour settlement period when your gay paper hands let you down and deprive you of an early retirement... Just call and ask them ""Can you please move my shares from Margin to Cash on the ledger?""

**FWIW, My Active Trader Pro Was Glitchy From 9:30 - 9:38 am This Morning (Thursday):** I had positions that weren't moving, values on calls from other holdings that weren't updating the price, etc.  He said others had this problem and not to worry as they don't expect it to be a major issue.  It honestly did not cause any problems for me but for eight minutes it was concerning to say the least.

5107,Buy,GME,,dryblueink,l7kxtz,116,621,"Here's what I've been thinking about, in preparation for the Friday. The glorious Friday we have dreamt of all week. It has been a tough journey here, and our diamond hands are getting all sorts of sweat-based deterioration. I'm sure that you've heard the terms gamma squeeze, short interest and call options a million times by now. 

This might be fairly obvious, but I thought it should be said. 

So why is the gamma squeeze happening? To cover all the call options these market makers (CITADEL INCLUDED) sold you. These are DEEEEEEP in the money, and will cost these big finance fuckers a significant amount of money to cover. So they're going to come at you with all sorts of attacks to bring the cost of the stock down, so they can get you the stocks at a discounted price. 

Here are the possible outcomes for retail call holders: 

1. You sell the option back to the market maker, probably pretty good money but does not contribute to the gamma squeeze
2. You let them expire (but like why would you, worst of the 3 options) 
3. You EXERCISE your option - ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE DEEP ITM options. I'm talking about those 3$ calls, the 10$ calls, etc etc. If you believe that there is a bigger, more drastic squeeze coming post the gamma squeeze, DON'T FUCKING SELL. Flip your call options into 100 STOCKS PER CONTRACT cuz that is a gold mine about to become rocket fuel. Because not only can this make you money, IT IS WHAT WILL CAUSE THE GAMMA SQUEEZE. It will drive up the mandatory demand for the stock that is already illiquid as is, and once they run out of $GME stocks they hold, THEY CAN'T EVEN PULL PLAYS ON US. No more of these dead drops. No more low volume sells while we watch helplessly on our ""Sell only"" Robinhood screens. 

If situation 3 plays out, we should see the gamma squeeze we've been anticipating all week, and we shall get the appetizer tendies we've been waiting for tomorrow. Personally, I'm going to wait till short interest dips hard, which may be tomorrow, maybe next week, not sure. But exercising these options is a general win for team retail investors. 

As everyone says, this is my opinion, and my thought process and by no means, a real financial advice. If you're a call holder, no one will seriously blame you if you have to sell it. However, I strongly urge anyone with the buying power and the call options to exercise them tomorrow and hold your 100x#ofcontract number of shares with us on our journey past pluto to MACS0647-JD, the farthest visible universe from us.

As everyone says, this is my opinion, and my thought process and by no means, a real financial advice. If you're a call holder, no one will seriously blame you if you have to sell it. However, I strongly urge anyone with the buying power and the call options to exercise them tomorrow and hold your 100x#ofcontract number of shares with us on our journey past pluto to MACS0647-JD, the farthest visible universe from us.

**Total Addressable Market (TAM) Evaluation:**

Tilray Operates in three main regions: Canada, Europe, United States.

Canada:

* Expected to reach $4 Billion in Cannabis sales by end of 2021. Tilray has a 17% market share, with a goal to reach 30%
* Canada's cannabis market is expected to grow twice as fast as the U.S. market between 2020 and 2021 and almost three times faster from 2021 to 2022
* Tilray is well positioned with strong edible, vape, and beverage brands as users steadily switch to cannabis 2.0 products
* Canadian black market is nearly the same size as the legal market, however it is steadily declining which adds TAM for LPƒ??s

Europe:

* EU GDP = $15 Trillion
* Population = 600 Million
* GMP certified grow facility in Portugal can export anywhere in EU 
* Dominant position in Germany with CC Pharma distribution network (access to 13,000 pharmacies)
* European cannabis market to be worth $3.8 Billion USD by 2025, growing at a 67.4% CAGR

United States:

* CBD market growing at a CAGR of 42%, expected to reach $13 Billion by 2024
* Manitoba Harvest sells CBD and Hemp products throughout the U.S. in grocery stores and online (Amazon)
* SweetWater Brewery sells cannabis themed alcohol nationally in 29,000+ grocery stores. Upon legalization they can begin crafting and distributing CBD and THC products using their distribution network.
* Tilray does NOT currently sell ANY THC products in the U.S. because they would be at risk of losing their Nasdaq listing.
   * SAFE Banking (bipartisan support) can potentially change this and allow them to execute an M&amp;A deal with an MSO as well as allow them to begin producing and selling THC products inside the U.S. (Can NOT export cannabis from Canada)

Analysts are wrong:

* This graph shows the average price target, and Tilray stock price
* One obvious pattern is that Tilray is bullish when it is above the average analyst target.
* 2 years ago the average price target was 40-80, and now the fundamentals are better than ever, and analysts only expect the share price to reach 22

[Tilray Price compare to Consensus Price Target](https://preview.redd.it/qkwyy0zi8m671.png?width=1355&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0ba95ebdc77e397ff2e07e030d9a289929bd508)

My Technical Analysis:

* The first Fibonacci level of interest for a retracement of the move from 300 to 2 is the .382 level which has a price of 116, hence the 116 price target.
* This lines up perfectly with my Elliot Wave analysis which has a projection for a new wave higher into the Fib level

**Summary:**

Tilray is the dominant player in two high growth international markets that are expected to grow much faster than the U.S. providing 25-35% sales CAGR over the next 2+ years. EPS is expected to turn positive in the next 1-2 Years, Sales are projected to be over $1 Billion by 2022. Despite being the largest player in Canada by market share, Tilray trades at a price/sales ratio of 13 while competitors Sundial, Cronos and CGC trade at 38, 59 and 20 PS respectively.

This sub has been bringing up one of my favorite stocks right now, **CRSR**, which although undervalued by almost any metric (the street target is sitting at about $47 - right above ATH and 50% upside) yet has been trading flat in the low 30s range. I want to talk about why it stayed so steady, why this makes it the PERFECT opportunity for entry (especially on leaps- low IV on the contracts, but short-term theta is a killer).  

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:** Since CRSR IPO'd in 2020, it has done nothing but surprise investors. Posting its first profitable year, increasing revenues, and paying off debt. Not to mention they threw a few acquisitions in there to further diversify the business. Originally investors were amazed, which caused over a 200% rally in share price. 

**Why it's Flat:** Since then, the market has been too worried about the vaccines and reopening efforts hurting their sales. But as we have all probably realized over the past year and a half -  gaming, streaming, and building computers AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. If anything there are more consumers interested than ever before. CRSR has also taken steps to expand its business and establish itself as one of the biggest sponsors in streaming. Think of Nike or Red Bull - but for Esports. By growing their sponsored gamer teams, they attract the next generation of gamers and consumers who want to have the same products as their favorite gamers - the same way you still buy Jordans.

**Factors for Moon:** The most obvious is the fundamental undervaluation for CRSR. While most stocks keep pushing higher, CRSR has not seen love for months, even after posting great earnings at the beginning of May. While AMD has begun to rally and NVDA hits new ATH, people fail to realize that as they grow so does CRSR. What happens when NVDA or AMD comes out with a new product people buy? They get some CRSR accessories and peripherals to go with their new devices. The market is failing to see the amazing opportunity right in front of it.

**Let us not forget the 22% short interest ratio, which is why the rally last week couldn't hold. The rally also had 20x the average daily volume, if the market begins to realize CRSRs potential soon that type of volume will be normal, and so will a price between $45-$58 (my own targets from DCF model built).** 

Yet again, what do I know - I'm a  retarded finance student (how did I even get to college) and I eat crayons. Therefore this is not financial advice.

9289,Buy,PLTR,,domotorbeni,lpl3vw,94,356,"Listen up, my fellow .trads! You might be sick of PLTR posts and DD-s, but in spite of it, I am going to explain why PLTR is going to skyrocket. However, it is essential to think about my fellow retards who went full autistic and the guys who can still read some crayons. So that is why I am going to make a short detailed(at the end) DD and a longer one as well. The main question we are going to focus on; why PLTR is going a lot higher than it is now?! But first, let me make one thing very obvious: this is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), not [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) so we don't give a fck if the particular stock is already up 15%(sometimes we like it even more) because we like taking big risks if the potential award is also big! Please choose your side and read either the long (IF you can read) or the short (full retard mode) version.

**Extended version:**

We had a very volatile few weeks behind us. Earnings were published, Cathie Wood bought the dip because *she likes the stock* and the broader market is having a correction. Despite all this, the chart looks *remarkably bullish.* Now, please take a look at the 3-hourly chart, and if you have a basic understanding of the stock market's astrology(TA), you will recognize that we had a huge breakout on Jan 25th. Later, we dipped so hard, I couldn't have guessed. Buut, the chart remained bullish, how?? Oh well... we jumped back from the previous *resistance* level, so essentially: we just had a huge *backtest.* It seems that we created a *bottom*. The reason I am saying this is: *MACD* is about to *cross*, shittons of stock changed hands (huge volume) and we *closed* near *intraday high*, despite the broader market correction. Wait, there is more: RSI has a *lot of room* to grow and there is an *unfilled gap* between 30.53- 31.45, which will pull the price upward. IF we can break the resistance at 29.07, then we will have a fine run-up to 34.09-34.68, but be cautious, the volume has to be high, throughout that breakout! Once we reached that level: we might consolidate for some time, please do not shit your pants. Some healthy *consolidation* is good before making any leg higher. My mid-term price target is between 40.75-41.97. Strong support is at 26.27

*Processing img w26dcuuc90j61...*

This is all great, but I have to discuss the *risks involved* in this trade as well! Please take a glimpse at the chart below. The earnings announcement caused a small IV *crush*, but it still *high IMO*. The other danger I want to introduce is the bearish EMA outlook. The *8 EMA* crossed the *21 EMA* from above. Also, we couldn't close above 8 EMA on Friday, which means: the white line is a strong resistance. Last but not least; if the *broader market* continues to *tank*, then we might have a hard time starting the rocket engines even might have to postpone the launch to the MOON.

 Now, for the paper-handed bitches, here are some facts to make your hands stronger. *Cathie Wood* bought up the dip, massively. The Graphs (below) show us here stakes in PLTR and the freshest purchases. She nearly *tripled* her holdings in a WEEK!!

3161,Buy,BBBY,,scaling_gamer,kyatuw,69,115,"Hey, it's your OG BBBY bull. Since people asked, here's a deeper dive into why I'm bullish on BBBY.

# Overview

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries is an omnichannel retailer that sells a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home, Baby, Beauty and Wellness markets. It's subsidaries include Buy Buy Baby, Face Values, and Decoris.

# Leadership

* **Mark Tritton - CEO (ex target vice president and chief marketing officer)**
   * **COMPLETELY turned around Target into what it is today**
      * Launched **40 successful private label brands**
      * **Transformed** their digital market
      * Remodeled **850 stores**
      * Lead to **6 consecutive** quarters of growth at target
   * **He plans to do the same at BBBY and this becomes clear in the 3 year turnaround plan**
* **Rafeh Masoor**
   * Far less known, but very innovative from a digital standpoint
      * ""Top 10 movers and shakers in retail""
   * Strong results at BJ's wholesale club
   * He brings a strong 3 pronged approach to the digital scene
      * digital first mindset with a BOPIS and free delivery
      * virtual rooms and improved ui to elevate customer experience
      * develop omni capabilities

# Turnaround Plan

* **Deepen Relations With Customers**
   * Retain and grow their **INCREASING** customer base with incentives and marketing
   * **Focus on their 5 segments in marketing**
      * the juggler, the innovator, the nester, the creative, and the minimizer
   * create **loyalty progams** to increase retention
* **Resetting Product Assortment**
   * Releasing BBBY's unique **private label brands** to penetrate the market and raise margin
   * increase the range of prices on products to invite lower spenders to the store
   * creating ""destination rooms"" to **elevate customer experience**
* **Offer competitive pricing**
   * BBBY wants to remain competitive in pricing while filling price gaps between products
   * **Study promotional data** to **maximize return** on coupons
* **Omnichannel**
   * Integrate physical locations with the digital setting
      * BOPIS (buy online pickup in store)
   * This will allow customers to venture into physical locations as well
* **Remodeling**
   * As stated earlier BBBY wants to **create customer friendly stores**
   * Currently, BBBY's stores look like ugly department stores and things are unaccessible
   * They are remodeling **450 stores over 3 years**
      * **the remodels are exactly what I wanted to see**
* **Creating stronger technology platform**
   * Better app and better website = more digital sales

As a BBBY shopper, **this addresses ALL my issues with the stores** atm.

As an investor, it's clear that **BBBY knows their audience and how they can regain market share and capitalize on their customers.**

Tritton clearly has a **GREAT vision** and **knows what he needs to do to** make it a reality.

REMEMBER this is a 3 year long plan, which means it will take time to fully come to fruition.

**If this is successful, BBBY will be a leader in the industry and the stock will reach highs unseen for years. With the leadership, I expect BBBY to successfully execute this plan, constantly top expectations, and prove the shorters wrong.**

# Q3 Financials

* **Profitability**
   * Profit margin is at a **historically high level of 35%**
      * **10% increase YoY** lead by lowered payroll, improved promo management, and product mix
   * SG&amp;A **lowered** by 41 million
* **Cash Flow and EBITDA**
   * **Cash flow of 244 million** compared to a **negative** cash flow last year
   * EBITDA **growth of 168% from -.38 cents to .08 cents**
* **Comp and digital Sales**
   * For the first time in 6 years, BBBY is showing comparable sales growth in the last 2 quarters
   * **Digital sales up 94%**
   * In store traffic **decreasing**
* **Market Share**
   * For the first time in ages, BBBY saw market shares growth in the Home and kitchen departments
   * Reversal of a negative trend in other departments
* **Cash and Debt**
   * Cash is increasing to a solid 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents
   * debt lowered by 500 million (25%) this year
* **Revenue and Net income**
   * Revenue is DECREASING by 5% YoY
      * store closures and lowered in store traffic
   * Net Income is INCREASING
      * lower performing stores gone means higher profits

Yes, earnings missed estimates, but as Tritton said, **he is doing everything he said he would do.**

**The balance sheet is improving, he is executing his plan steadily, and he is overall reassuring investors with his buybacks.**

BBBY is focusing on optimizing their top performing stores as the country is over satured with stores currently. With unprofitable stores closing, **we can expect a decreasing overall revenue, but an increasing net income.**

As the plan continues, I fully expect overall revenue to **reverse the trend, and begin increasing.**

Investors were also disappointed with guidance, but **Tritton has mentioned that he is being CONSERVATIVE in estimates**. He has always one to be conservative and deliver more than expected.

# Tailwinds

* **Growing customer base**
* A general **shift towards home improvement**
* **New private label brands** are profitable and would help gain market share in 2021
* **150 stores** being remodeled in 2021
* **Stimulus** and perhaps more from Biden
* Return to ""normal"" would lead to a **large surge in marriages and babies**

# Headwinds

* COVID worsening and restrictions returning
* **Twitter trying to get BBBY cancelled for selling MyPillow**

# Buybacks

Normally, I am against share buybacks. BBBY used them previously to suppport a dying stock, but here it's different.

BBBY currently has an accelerated share repurchase program of 850  million dollars with 150 million to be repurchased by february 29th.

With excess cash from selling unprofitable businesses, **Tritton seeks to regain investor confidence WHILE producing obvious changes and results.**

Due to these buybacks, I expect share prices to grow over the next few months leading up to earnings.

# Short Interest

Currently, short interest is astronomically high at \~70%. I believe that this has decreased as a hedge fund bearish on GME and BBBY seems to have covered at the same time.

Check the spike on GME and BBBY 1/13 11:30. It's likely Melvin or mapleridge covered a short position.

With Cramer pumping and this, we saw a mild squeeze, **but there are no more catalysts to cause another for a while;** however, with buybacks and strong performance, shorters will slowly buy back their shares alongside BBBY, causing **a steady rise in price in the following months.**

**If the turnaround plan is successful, shorts will have no reason to remain bearish, and BBBY will grow exponentially in price over the next 6-12 months.**

# TLDR

**Bed Bath and Beyond is on the road to success.**

**As a consumer, their private label brands, store remodels, and specialized marketing changes are exactly what I want to see.**

**In a growing industry, strong leadership, buybacks, and a beautiful turnaround plan make me bullish on BBBY.**

**I do NOT expect growth akin to what happened this week, but expect strong growth as the sentiment towards BBBY changes and their plan succeeds over the next few months.**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First off this message is not financial advice. I just wanted to inform people of future catalyst that we are about to hit.

AMC is hyped and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I suggest you to buy as much as you can within a value that you are comfortable sitting on for the next month. I think there is a potential for huge returns. We have multiple events that could work as catalysts for some significant future gains.

Here they are:

* FINRA reports (2/25 release): this will help us confirm if there is still an opportunity for a short squeeze
* Q4 Earnings (3/5 release): this could cause a huge spike in buys since I expect to see an uptrend in revenue due to states opening back up. Also keep in mind the last bump allowed AMC to pay off a bunch of their built up debt caused by COVID-19 closing
* COVID-19 vaccines: large number of people are getting the vaccine which will cause a surge in hope for the light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday we saw what happened when NYC announced re-opening of all of their theaters to 25%

I repeat this is not financial advice and I don't want you to buy due to FOMO but I think this bet has a good short term and long term play. Short term is we get a nice short squeeze. Long term is the stock settles to over $20 like its competitors. The worlds largest theater chain should not be trading for 1/4 of its competition.

If you want to play it relatively safe then please only invest money that will not needed for at least a year. This way you can play the short and long game.

Love you all! I hope this is prosperous for you all and any money troubles you have can be washed away! Go get them apes!

11377,Hold,AMD,,darkfiber-,n4r47g,155,534,"I read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist.

**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?

**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). 

After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/upndown#!\/vizhome\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\_16114624177710\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/wvsnql2p64x61.png?width=1184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21b19380ad8d798a8e2c8c6d8736d97714c553cd)

In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/gi31myc384x61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b1036b008d8c9fea2f74996f7e3c5cf70410e2)

What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. 

So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/xijh87hfb4x61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc144da8bbba46b37ddb59f18d306bbad6104599)

I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). 

For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.

The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.

Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.

""In June 2007, Szulczewski transferred to Googleƒ??s new office in South Korea and got a lesson in tech outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Koreans preferred search portals that were busy and crowded with information over clean, minimalist home pages like Googleƒ??s. Former Google colleague Mark Rabkin remembers debating the point with Szulczewski when he visited. ƒ??I could tell he was starting to think like a local,ƒ? says Rabkin, whoƒ??s now an ad executive at Facebook. The experience would help shape Szulczewskiƒ??s strategy for Wish: He learned to focus on building something people wanted rather than what Silicon Valley thought they should want.""  


Does WISH sell shitty products?  


""Wishƒ??s open-door policy meant that sales were taking off, but so were quality-control problemsƒ??which is somewhat inevitable when you have one million registered merchants, of whom 125,000 are active on Wish each month. By way of context, Amazon hosts an estimated 2.5 million active third-party merchants, while Walmart has roughly 21,000, according to Marketplace Pulse, a New York-based e-commerce intelligence firm.?ÿ 

To tackle this, Wish automatically culls about 8 million products over a week, or close to 3% of all products available on the site. Most are cut because visitors have scrolled past an item at least 1,000 times and havenƒ??t tapped on it once. Wish also culls products from merchants whoƒ??ve received bad reviews or put up fake reviews. To automatically detect the fakes, Wishƒ??s engineers trained its software on reviews that were obviously made up. One example: ƒ??Did not expect so soon, the owner of service enthusiasm.ƒ? Now the software can identify reviews with similar nonsensical phrases.

Szulczewski seems unfazed by the quality-control challenge, pointing out that sometimes customers themselves are the problems.""We sell 5 million contact lenses a year. Someone's going to sleep in them.""Overall, there is a set of roughly 60 rules. If Wishƒ??s algorithms see that a merchant has listed counterfeit products or shipped an order with a fake tracking number, theyƒ??ll be ƒ??finedƒ? $500. Shipping a package with no product spells a potential $10,000 fine. Wish collects around $3 million a month in fines, and it can do that by simply withholding payments from merchants, says Szulczewski. Merchants can also get kicked off the platform, he adds. On the flip side, good reviews can lead to faster payments or a higher ranking in search.?ÿ

Zhang, who is 6,000 miles away, overseeing operations in three locations in China with 150 staff members, is just as paranoid about being gamed. ƒ??Merchants definitely care about making money first,ƒ? Zhang says. The rules and monitoring software donƒ??t always go down well. ƒ??The merchants look at Wishƒ??s platform as very robotic,ƒ? he says, meaning thereƒ??s no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.

?ÿƒ??Itƒ??ll never be perfect,ƒ? admits Tung, the GGV investor. ƒ??You get what you pay for.ƒ? But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, ƒ??just like our iPhones.ƒ??ÿ

The rules and monitoring software donƒ??t always go down well. ƒ??The merchants look at Wishƒ??s platform as very robotic,ƒ? he says, meaning thereƒ??s no way for merchants to negotiate a better deal by cultivating personal relationships with Wish staff.

?ÿƒ??Itƒ??ll never be perfect,ƒ? admits Tung, the GGV investor. ƒ??You get what you pay for.ƒ? But Szulczewski paints a rosier picture. The flywheel of customer data going into Wish will mean more reviews, smarter targeting software and, eventually, better-quality items. Those unbranded smartphones will get better every year, he says, ƒ??just like our iPhones.ƒ??ÿ

The year is 2200. Or 2500. I am one of the workers assembling batteries in Tesla's giga-gigafactory. I walk into the factory with a group of female workers. Actually they might be the entire cast of Orange Is the New Black. At least Natasha Lyonne is definitely there with me.

Somehow I feel super weak and can hardly breathe. Soon I remember that the oxygen level in the air has decreased so much over the past hundreds years that running or exercising has become virtually impossible. 

Papa Elon does not pay us. Or maybe it's like $3/hr. But the great thing is, we all get free Oxygen while we're working. Every worker has a Tesla Oxygen bottle with a tube that you can connect directly to the Oxygen tank under the assembling line. 

Natasha Lyonne is high as fuck on Oxygen. I start inhaling Oxygen as I feel super weak. Then I feel super good and untra good but then super bad very quickly. God the instant Oxygen rush feels so good I can still remember that feeing even it was all a dream.  

Some of the workers start to riot. One worker yells: ""We will never get to $1 per kilowatt-hour this year what's the point of all this?"" So we start protesting while holding the fancy Tesla Oxygen bottles. The funny thing is, no one can finish yelling a slogan without sucking that frothy addicting Oxygen Tesla tube multiple times. 

Elon's face, a gigantic hologram that occupies the whole giga-gigafactory, starts to emerge and morph into different faces and some abstract patterns. 

""S&amp;amp;P 500 inclusion next year is inevitable..,"" hologram Papa Elon declares confidently. 

I don't remember the rest of it. What does this all mean? I woke up feeling exuberant but also terrified.   Is this bullish or bearish? Any WSB dream interpreter? It's up 6% premarket. Must be a positive prophetic dream right?

??¯ Case: 

1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  

The digital game sales argument, like all ??¯  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the ??¯ are right, but theyƒ??re right in 8 years which means theyƒ??re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more
people go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers donƒ??t care about the fractionally
larger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. 

Blockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbusterƒ??s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbusterƒ??s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.

Gamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  

Everyone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.

2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt

This is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.

3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.

Gamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.

Gamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a ""digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment""

??? Case

This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  

This isnƒ??t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  

This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, youƒ??re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also donƒ??t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  

Simply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?

Long time no see.

Some of you may remember me from my two insane $AMD trades last year, both of which went up 1000%.  
I have one of those for you today.  


This is a multi-pronged thesis for why I went long on $AMD at these levels, which I will summarize in the following points :  


\-- Macro Picture --  
The market has just experience a major correction that last several months that was fueled by the fed tightening monetary policy. I believe the correction is over and the market has now gotten more used to a more hawkish fed.

The fed has gotten more Hawkish due to inflation, which I believe will begin stabilizing and even subsiding over the next several quarters.   
Primarily because  :  
1- Consumer demand and spending has been declining for two months and will continue to do so IMO, due to a moderation of govt spending bills, stimulus money running out and savings declining.

2- Because inflation of energy prices due to the Russian-Ukaranian war have mostly already been baked in since March.

Slowing inflation can give leeway to the fed to turn less hawkish, which can fuel a major bull market rally.  
\-- AMD's Fundamental Picture --  
AMD's price has gone down by nearly half since its major peak last year at around \~$160  
Nothing fundamental about AMD's business has changed . The company even raised its growth expectations for 2022 in its last earnings call. AMD is expected to grow its revenue by no less than 60% by the end of the year and more than double its profit.  
Demand for semiconductors continues to be very strong and will remain so for the remainder of the year.  
AMD successfully completed its acquisition of XLNX late last year, which strengthens AMD's competitive position in the server business, and area where the company has been kicking ass and taking record breaking market share from Intel.  In fact more than a quarter of all x86 CPUs sold today are AMD, the [highest market share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-4q-2021-2022-market-share-desktop-notebook-server-x86) in the history of the company.

The company is also expected to release the first ever 5nm x86 ""Zen 4"" CPUs [this year](https://www.techspot.com/news/92835-amd-ces-2022-roadmap-zen-4-am5-ryzen.html), which would extend its manufacturing process lead vs Intel and allow it capture even more market share and grow profitability and margins.

\-- AMD's Technical Picture --

1- I believe AMD has bottomed here at the \~$90 level.  
Why?  
\- We tagged the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 2018. The last time this happened AMD went up from $10 to $30 in six months.  
\- We hit a double bottom on the daily RSI after a major peak. The last time this happened was Dec 2018 and AMD went up by 60% the following 6 weeks.  
\- AMD has been on a very strong bullish trendline since 2016. The stock just entered the most attractive green buy zone on my hand drawn pitchfork channel. This has only happened 3 times in the last 5 years. Every time it happened in those 3 instances AMD went up by 38%, 240% &amp; 66% respectively.

Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!

**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.

New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings

Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&amp;P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)

**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didnƒ??t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.

**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.

**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)

**START**

I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, Iƒ??ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are ƒ??coincidencesƒ? as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Covariance &amp; Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on ƒ??luckƒ? or ƒ??chanceƒ?. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to ƒ??luckƒ?. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

[u\/big\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)

For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.

**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields.

However, whenever I mentioned this idea, Iƒ??ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are ƒ??coincidencesƒ? as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Covariance &amp; Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on ƒ??luckƒ? or ƒ??chanceƒ?. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to ƒ??luckƒ?. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

[u\/big\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)

For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.

**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so I have updated to include todayƒ??s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading ????

\------------

**Part 1: FINRA**

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

https://preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74

https://preview.redd.it/3jkeam6o12k61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31ac92005edf92bc4ff3180840c376322d3f571

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

https://preview.redd.it/jvvu6wat12k61.png?width=449&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75eb1ee3899e6bead49611fd2fb68ad380ba4030

\----------

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Brokerƒ??s FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

https://preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

\----------

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274

[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

&gt;ƒ??ƒ??we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).ƒ?

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

\----------

**TLDR:**

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **????????** ???? will prevail!!!

**Stake:** shares in GME **????** **????** **????**

**PS:** you guys! Iƒ??m truly honored by how popular youƒ??ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an ??? could ever want! Iƒ??ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)

Shoutouts to [u/RicFlairsCape](https://www.reddit.com/u/RicFlairsCape/) [u/Rrrrandle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rrrrandle/) [u/CultureCrypto](https://www.reddit.com/u/CultureCrypto/) for some good suggestions on the last post, which I have incorporated.

\----------

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF.

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so I have updated to include todayƒ??s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading ????

\------------

**Part 1: FINRA**

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

\----------

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Brokerƒ??s FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

https://preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

\----------

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274

[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

&gt;ƒ??ƒ??we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).ƒ?

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

\----------

**TLDR:**

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **????????** ???? will prevail!!!

**Stake:** shares in GME **????** **????** **????**

**PS:** you guys! Iƒ??m truly honored by how popular youƒ??ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an ??? could ever want! Iƒ??ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

**Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 ƒ?? 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (itƒ??s actually big but itƒ??s GME weƒ??re talking about so Iƒ??m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, thatƒ??s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this weekƒ??s price action (and potentially next weekƒ??s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.

Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who donƒ??t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.

Itƒ??s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they arenƒ??t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so thatƒ??s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.

**Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, itƒ??s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.

Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say itƒ??s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who donƒ??t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet thatƒ??ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.

Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.

**RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high theyƒ??re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME wouldƒ??ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didnƒ??t halt buying, so donƒ??t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!

**Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics donƒ??t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didnƒ??t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they donƒ??t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.

**How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.

**Catalysts**: One of the most important things that Iƒ??ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). Iƒ??m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time thereƒ??s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.

**The Point**: The point of this is that ITƒ??S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as itƒ??s very short: [https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)

The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, itƒ??s that wall street doesnƒ??t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and wonƒ??t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.

STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFEƒ??S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (Iƒ??m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, Iƒ??m just a dude with a small penis)

**EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that itƒ??s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say ƒ??HF wonƒ??t fuck up again they learned from their mistakesƒ? .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.

Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.

I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!

**Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics donƒ??t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didnƒ??t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they donƒ??t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.

**How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.

**Catalysts**: One of the most important things that Iƒ??ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). Iƒ??m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time thereƒ??s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.

**The Point**: The point of this is that ITƒ??S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as itƒ??s very short: [https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)

The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, itƒ??s that wall street doesnƒ??t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and wonƒ??t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.

STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFEƒ??S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (Iƒ??m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, Iƒ??m just a dude with a small penis)

**EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that itƒ??s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say ƒ??HF wonƒ??t fuck up again they learned from their mistakesƒ? .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.

Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.
