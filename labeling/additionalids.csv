Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well.

I don't know what is the truth anymore.

If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is 98.4% ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.

Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.

Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.

If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.

3442,,,,geomanis,l07ly5,168,415,"Hello fellow bagholders,

I am a palantir autist, aka, i've actually used foundry for 2-3 years at old workplace. I thought I'd write a piece to explain technically what it does, so you can feel more comfortable holding the bags and continue your confirmation bias.

# What is Foundry?

Foundry aggregates data from disparate systems and then allows non-technical users to combine, correlate, and chart it in many different ways. Here are how it works:

# Connect Data-Sources or upload data

Palantir uses a combination of Cassandra (for writing data quickly) and Parquet (for doing ad-hoc analysis) and SparkQL which helps do distributed data computing. I am not a data nerd, I don't understand this well, but it's much better than trying to do it yourself and getting eaten by Apache Alligators.

Enterprise users give authentication string to the Palantards, and they do either a pull or push from that data-store into Cassandra, which then writes it all over the place. Data analysis is done w/ Map-Reduce and Parquet tables to be ZOOOOOM.

I've seen people connecting p. much anything, whether it's Structued Query Language, Mongo, Comma-separated Value files (Automod didn't like the abbreviation), logs, excel spreadsheets, images, html, whatever. Can't say that it's a good idea connecting a bunch of these, but whatever we don't choose what garbage our employers like having their numbers and words in.

Anyway, data goes *PSSHHH* into Cassandra, Parquet goes *BRRR* and do SPEEDY data thing.

# Cleaning data using Blacksmith or code (Python or Apache Spark)

Okay, data is in AWS Parquet stores, but generally it sucks dick. Few examples of why it sucks:

* Country Code: US, USA, America, United States, US of A, MURIKA
* Name: Ree Tard, ReeTard, Ree, ree, Mr Ree Tard, Lord Ree\`Tard
* Date: 01/10/2021, 10th October 2021, 01/10/2021 (European though!)

So on, what this means is your data is super shit quality on ingestion. So you gotta write some code to look through all that data and make it Pristine *TM*. Nobody wants to make a chart seeing where all the retards who buy PLTR are from, and find that there are 40 variations of USA.

So you can do this with code, or something called Blacksmith. Blacksmith literally drag and drop simple web-ui click click delete garbage data, remove empty rows, format everything, replace dumb strings, etc.

Code gotta write stuff like.

       ^(?:(?:31(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13578]|1[02]))\1|(?:(?:29|30)(\/|-|\.)(?:0?[13-9]|1[0-2])\2))(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$|^(?:29(\/|-|\.)0?2\3(?:(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?(?:0[48]|[2468][048]|[13579][26])|(?:(?:16|[2468][048]|[3579][26])00))))$|^(?:0?[1-9]|1\d|2[0-8])(\/|-|\.)(?:(?:0?[1-9])|(?:1[0-2]))\4(?:(?:1[6-9]|[2-9]\d)?\d{2})$ 

But we're all retarded so we use Blacksmith.

# Using Ontology Transformations

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img g4dubmm6m6c61...*

Okay, so you see this beauty. This is whats called a Data Ontology. The left-hand side is your data-sources, step after that is the cleaning of that degenerate excel data into pristine shit.

This is where either palantards or enterprise nerdgineers will write Python or SparkQL code to try to combine data-sets but mostly where it doesn't make sense. Business often asks synergistic process optimisation stuff like ""Hey Nerd, please correlate license plates, blood types, and Club Nintendo memberships, thanks"". I don't get it, but O+ Nintendo gamers are clearly national security threats to put an all-points bulletin out for.

Examples of use cases I know, there are plane assets, and each plane has parts, and each part has data about it's testing, and each test was performed by an engineer at a location etc. So immediate ability to determine whether any part was not validated by an engineer at any location, to improve safety for planes.

Other use case was we have an asset, that asset has these IP addresses, these vulnerability reports, these log feeds, these people owning and being accountable for it, it located in this area, it connected to these other assets and to these business processes, etc. Quick analysis of your risk posture for various computer assets.

Sounds confusing, but it makes sense if you look at it as a graph problem, and the ontology is a good visualisation for how shitty disparate data can be combined to get actionable information.

# Contour

After you get your ""I have all data in one view"" table after the ontology transformations, people need to make decisions based on it. Often having a piece of data is all well and good but good luck looking at a 100 column table and understanding it.

Enter Contour. Contours a web interface that lets you do a bunch of hectic cool data-graphing shit with no training needed. Just beep boop button click &gt; INSIGHTS and AESTHETIC CHARTS.

You give so many options to people, that most of the time people can find a way to make whatever data they want conform to the outcome they are looking for. This is kinda useful to an enterprise, but mostly it keeps middle-management employed and happy, thus continuing to purchase additional palantir contracts and hype it up to their friends on the golf course, sponsored dinners, or businesstalk conferences. If you think that's a good thing, trust your instincts.

# Other Thoughts

Okay, so that's the gist of what Foundry is doing. Other things to note:

Forward Deployed Engineers are peeps who get shipped to workplaces worldwide and told to move excel datasheets into palantir for [250k a year](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Palantir/salaries/Software-Engineer/). Sweet gig, except it can be a mix between zero% and 120% stress level based on the retardation of the org you are working with. Since most orgs using Palantir are big enterprise, the retardation is higher than wallstreet bets and I bet you didn't think that was possible. forward deployed engineers have high turnover because they arent having fun working with weird requirements and usually take the job to get shipped to god knows where as a working holiday. They get paid better at [FANGMAN](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Facebook/salaries/Software-Engineer/) too.

Good news for Palantards is that since Palantir changes on-site employees every 3-6 months, it means nobody in the big enterprises or Palantir itself actually knows whats going on so any change and maintenance takes forever and are a consistent source of revenue.

Tech Expertise within enterprise is a sticking point too. [Banks](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Capital-One/salaries/Software-Engineer/Software-Eng/), [Government](https://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/2021/Table059301012021.aspx), etc don't pay big bucks for engineers compared to our FANGMANS, so the good peeps yeet off when possible. Generally, doing palantir ontology writing is literally doing plumbing except you get covered in shit always instead of occasionally. Either management asking why the transformation is taking so long (hint, 30 tables being pulled together at once is [N30 complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), no wonder it takes forever) or everything breaking from data edge cases (I can't believe we didn't think of people having a hyphenated last name???).

I know like 9 engineers hired to do palantir programming, all 9 left 3-4 months into the role to pickup literally anything else. One became an actual plumber. It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

It means that ontologies aren't maintained and rot over time so the org needs to keep getting palantard's or new entry-level data people who leave after 3 months, aka the product sticks around forever. Bullish.

Shit is slow. They're dealing with huge data, but Cassandra and Parquet + Map-Reduce are only so effective. Especially because each org insists on their own private cloud tenancy.

Contour is good, but people can draw dumb insights from it. If you just click random buttons you can probably find a chart that looks like you can use it for whatever empire-building you're attempting. Since most users have no stats or science education, they can infer incorrectly or plainly mis-inform each other from cherry-picked data. Very bullish for middle management.

Locally, I know 6 organisations that use Palantir, 2 are banks, 4 are spooks, so that's a good sign. Palantir is very secretive about who their other clients are. Their clients at meetup events are happy to be open about where they work though. Funny that.

Once management gets used to clicking on stuff in Contour and having automated reports, they don't want it to go away or to have to learn anything else. This is why we still use Windows 20 years later. Palantir is addictive data-porn.

**TLDR**

Give an animal like 8 things to eat, animal eats it up, sacrifice the animal and look at the entrails, interpret the entrails with your confirmation bias and do random shit. Forward Deployed Shamans change identity every few moons and mostly get more food for the animals to eat. Entrails are surprisingly aesthetic and animal-sacrificing becomes addictive because of that.

If you want to change focus create another subreddit with the other stonks or things, is crucial and very important to stay connected, stay with the eyes in the ball and motivated moving towards one direction. GME is the direction.

I’ve also noticed there are a lot of people fearing and a lot of shillas out there, don’t worry about it! Stay true with the reason why we are here and keep the focus! It’s gonna happen soon and it’s gonna happen if we stay together and strong! 

Hold hold fellow apes!! 

If you see a comment that is bias or it’s not positive towards the cause, read it and investigate it with a huge grain of salt, if doesn’t have facts or strong logic just dish it.

Get the big squeeze and then play with that money and put it in another opportunities. 

If you want to change focus create another subreddit with the other stonks or things, is crucial and very important to stay connected, stay with the eyes in the ball and motivated moving towards one direction. GME is the direction.

I’ve also noticed there are a lot of people fearing and a lot of shillas out there, don’t worry about it! Stay true with the reason why we are here and keep the focus! It’s gonna happen soon and it’s gonna happen if we stay together and strong! 

Hold hold fellow apes!! 

If you see a comment that is bias or it’s not positive towards the cause, read it and investigate it with a huge grain of salt, if doesn’t have facts or strong logic just dish it.

What if all the meme stocks did a crossover like the Marvel and DC Movies?

Maybe on 19th March there are a slew of annoucement

GME buys over Super League or hires Ann ( based on a post about Ryan Cohen's tweet ) 

GME and AMC has a joint venture to hold super league tournaments at AMC theatres

BB signs on to provide the cyber security thingy that they do for all the transactions in the tournaments and etc

NOK provides the 5G infrastructure for streaming?

They all use silver medals and cups for the trophies

RKT manages the mortgages for houses the teams to train?

For example, if you invested $1000 to buy 10 shares of GME at a SP of $100 and squeeze to $1000...I would recommend that you sell off 1 share of GME to recover your original $1000 then just HOLD the FUCK out of the other 9 shares 👋💎👋💎👋💎👋💎👋💎 until we hit some RIDICULOUS share price 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

11838,,,,jeremy_eee,nmdhm1,60,146,"At around $5, NOKIA is undervalued right now. It is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 17 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 19. Over the past 52 weeks, NOK's Forward P/E has been as high as 29.52 and as low as 10.50, with a median of 16.41.

Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. NOK has a P/S ratio of 1.09.

Dear 🌈🐻:

Yesterday you were happy. Very happy. For the first time in a long time. Finally, your predictions of doom and gloom had come to fruition. You had dreamed of the apocalypse: where your AMC $5 puts would print and your outrage at the valuation for TSLA would be justified. Yesterday signaled the beginning of a beautiful future. A future in which droves of retards would crash and burn, millions would go unemployed, dollar would become worthless and mohawked gangs would roam the earth while you and you alone could gloat while posting your gain porn on WSB. This is you from yesterday:

3675,,,,fuk_normies,l0gqd5,48,186,"Listen Lads, 

I come here with a confession... 

I uhhhh, you see, the thing is, well... I NEVER CARED for this GME fetish you retards had going on here. 

Yep. Nada. Zippo. Zilch. 

I saw thread after thread, meme after meme, post after post, GME THIS, COHEN THAT, something about peanuts and NASA, “MoTheR of AlL ShOrT SquEeZe ReEEEEEee” ...all this insufferable bullshit ... and just kept thinking to myself, when the fuck will this end and this sub reddit can get back on track... 

Well... That was then. This is now. 

I don’t think some of you realize what a historic moment this has become, and what it represents. We are at an inflection point, a moment in history where future generations in 2040 will look back and say “Good men stood here, good men fought, and died on this ground” as they point to a TradingView daily chart of GME 2021 zoomed in on January...

Listen to me lads: 

Since the spawn of the stonk market, two classes of people have been pitted against each other, eternal enemies, forever forced and fated to combat—Lions and Hyenas. 

These Lions—these Wall Street hedge funds have it all. Quants, billions of dollars, algorithmic trading, arbitrage, market makers in their pockets, supercomputers, trading on inside information, SEC protection, fucking Judicial System Protection for Gods sake. Bail outs for reckless trades. Government protection. These dirty fucking criminal bastards have it all. 

And then, there’s us—the lowly Hyenas—retail—the working Man... The Average Joe. What do we have? WHAT THE FUCK DO WE HAVE? We’re ugly, we drool, we laugh stupid. 

THEY LITERALLY CALL US “DUMB” MONEY!

Dumb... money. They call us dumb, money. 

These lions, these hedge funds guys, they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, the top 1% of the 1%. They were given offices, overlooking beautiful NY city skyline... for nothing. They have massive bank accounts, eat medium rare Grade A Japanese Wagyu steak with truffle shavings for lunch. They wash that down with Macallan. They frequent the finest strip clubs on the planet on a first name basis and instantly go to the back rooms. They have blow and escorts on their yacht parties on the DAILY. The fucking... daily. 

And do you know what they tell these beautiful escorts? Do you know? When the smoking hot blonde escort with 5 million Instagram followers creeps in and asks them “Like, how do you have so much moneyyy?” 

You know what they say? 

They reply: “Haha, Dumb money babe. Dumb, money”





Dumb... money. 

Lads, this $GME trade is about class warfare. 

We may be hyenas yes, we may be retarded hyenas yes, we may be autistic hyenas YES, but guess what, you put enough of us together, and we can destroy a lion. 

Listen to me. These dirty fucking criminal hedge funds are scared. Just look at Cramer:

1) He’s called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies 

2) He’s congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)

3) He’s congratulated WSB on the “short squeeze” (implying that little thing, was it—hoping we’ll back off)

Listen to me: 

You know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. 

This is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they’re cornered. 

Cramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They’re all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. 

...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. 

I swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn’t believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I’ve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. 

I’m throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I’m fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain’t so dumb anymore...

Hey fellow traders. Today, l’ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.

&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)

Firstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It’s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it’s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.

On the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. 

I attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don’t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)

On the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff’s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. 

On the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day’s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski’s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day’s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. 

We must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday’s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff’s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool’s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.

Lastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.

No one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock.

If history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish

I’ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.

You own at least 900 shares of AMC, well that means you can sell 9 covered calls to suckers on this sub. You might sell an option with a $10 strike price that will expire 3/12 and each option might be worth $50 in premium, I don’t know. So 9\*50=$450 dollars. Way to go. Go invest that money.

But mac1222, what happens if the price of the stock hits or goes above $10? Well, [u/isellgoodqualitygood](https://www.reddit.com/u/isellgoodqualitygood/), then your 900 shares will be “called” away and you’ll be paid $10 a share for each stock. That’s 9000 dollars. Don’t forget about the $450 you made!

What if the stock goes to $20 before the options expire. Well, mr good, you’ve lost out on a lot of potential profit. If you kept the stock, you would have made $18,000. But let me say it again....loss of potential profit. You never lost any of your original investment.

What if the stock does not hit $10? Well then, the options expire worthless and you keep the premium.

What if I want out of my contracts before expiration? Easy. Remember, when selling an option, you are “selling to open”. You will show “-9” because you are short. To get out of this agreement, you will have to “buy to close” those 9 contracts. Now you will have to pay the premium to buy them back. Poof....the transaction is over

Additionally, you will not be able to sell your 900 shares while you are under a contract. Your brokerage will hold them as collateral until the options expire; thus a covered call",Basics of a Covered Call by u/Mac1222,44259.86458,t3_ly385x,"Basics of a Covered Call by u/Mac1222 Seen a lot of users upset that they cant sell the call or buy the call or what the hell is the call.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp my friends. Like 2 days ago I said if Palantir made it to $30 by the end of the year, I’d give out a PS5 to someone in this subreddit.

While a 50% gain over 6 weeks sounded aggressive, turns out things are moving a tad faster around here.

Looks like we are over $30 in Europe. Fuck it. Let’s do this draw now. It’s American Thanksgiving after all.

\--

But before I live up to my promise and get into the details of how you enter this draw, I think I would be remiss if I didn’t use this opportunity to get my thoughts in about Palantir.

**First and foremost, will everyone who is calling PLTR a quote “meme stock” shut the hell up?**

Just because a bunch of gorilla IQ memers happen to be buying something, does not mean that the thing they are buying is stupid. All those dingleberries also own Androids and iPhones, does that doesn’t mean Google and Apple are “meme companies”? No.

Unlike actual meme stocks such as: unprofitable weed companies, camera companies gone pharma, car rental companies gone bankrupt, and little airlines living off corporate welfare - Palantir is actually a ROCK SOLID COMPANY with an extremely promising future.

This rally was predictable and **it will keep on going in the long run.**

Myself and many others in WSB, r/investing and r/stocks got in on day one - not out of chance - but because we did our due diligence and we could see the writing on the wall: Palantir has the potential to possibly become one of the most important tech companies in the world, and it is being led by people with a track record to back it up.

This stock isn’t mooning because we have posted 10,000 memes and shit posts. I'm sorry kiddos and Cramer, but our TikTok videos with a few thousand views aren't powerful enough to create $25B of stock market value.

There is something much larger at play here, and we in WSB are lucky enough to be along for the ride.

PLTR is heading to Mars because the financial institutions didn’t have the opportunity to get in before the IPO and now they are racing to catch up. Moreover, now that **Palantir’s first quarterly report has proven they are the real deal,** and everyone has started googling this pandora’s box of a company - the market is going “holy shit”.

The only question mark that was in Palantir’s path was the impact Joe Biden’s administration might have on the company's relationship with the US government.

With a former Palantir consultant Avril Haines at the helm of the entire US intelligence community as of this week, the risk of the new administration working against Palantir has been all but removed.

That’s why we are up bigly this week.

But more importantly, **you need to consider the global technological context of this company, to truly understand its future potential.**

1. In the 90’s PC’s took over. 
2. In the 2000’s it was all about the .coms.
3. The 2010’s was the era of wireless and mobile platforms.
4. 2020 WILL be the decade of smart automation through a global wifi network.

And because of that, there is now an information and technology cold war brewing. China and USA are racing to get control of the global internet infrastructure, and they are doing everything they can to invent true AI. 

Once the entire world and everything in your home goes “smart” and becomes connected to Starlink’s grid, someone or some*thing* is going to need to sift through the quintillions of zeroes and ones, to make sense of it all in real time. Guess who is **the only company in the world that has the know-how and business/political connections to fill that void?**

At the risk of getting too deep in the weeds here, I need to mention one last detail: You all need to read up on Project Maven.

For those of you who don't know, Project Maven is an AI drone project that Google was originally supposed to fulfill for the US Airforce. Google walked from the contract citing ""ethical"" concerns, and then Palantir picked up the pieces. Imagine how pissed the US Airforce was when Google called them unethical and embarrassed them?

This has a **very** important underlying implication. If you accept the premise that the American government is going ham in this technological revolution, there still remains the question as to who will be the primary benefactor. 

Common sense would suggest that companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft will be working with the US government to create AI. However, Project Maven changed all that. 

Google's refusal to fulfill their top secret contract taught the government that they cannot trust the trillion dollar megacaps to be unequivocally and unapologetically pro-USA. Those companies are so big, that they don't need to choose a side in geopolitics, and they will almost certainly continue to offer their products to everyone around the world. 

When it comes to matters of national cybersecurity, the odds are that **the US government is going to put all it's eggs in a company that is unquestionably loyal and patriotic.** When the pentagon is creating a trillion dollar AI behemoth, they know they need to work with someone they can trust when push comes to shove. Palantir is the only AI company that is bold enough to do so, and **their founders have created a special the corporate share structure to ensure they will never lose control**.

So again, this is not a fucking ""meme stock"".

PLTR is mooning like your pubescent boner on viagra because everyone is starting to realize that this **magnificent titan the CIA created** (*see In-Q-Tel*) has gone public and will probably be at the forefront of the next global technological revolution.

So: 

* Stop worrying about a dip next week. (*Yes it might happen. So what?*)
* Stop worrying about a price crash post lock up. (*This will happen. But from what price to what price? Who cares?*)
* Stop trying to time the market to squeeze out an extra $1000. (*We aren’t smart enough or fast enough to win that game.*)
* Stop viewing Palantir like it’s a penny stock. It’s not.

**Start** looking at the year 2030 and imagine what you will do with your money then, if you grow the man balls (or lady balls) required to hold that long.

How you handle your positions over the next 6-12 months may be the most important decision of your life: do... not... sell…

There are only a handful of times in your life when a person should truly go all in. 1) When you meet the person you know you want to marry. When you decide to change your career. And when a company like Palantir goes public.

In 10 years, you can thank me. Today, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration.

God speed.

First, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.

I've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.

As much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.

Depending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.

**Options Explained**

***The Basics***

Buying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).

* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.  
* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.

Selling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.

* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.
* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

***The Money***

For Calls:

* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.

For Puts:

* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current strike price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

***Calls Explained***

Buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)

This is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.

* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even
* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent
* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars
* Price - Price of the option

In the above example:

* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.

The Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.

***Buying Naked Calls***

Ok, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.
* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**
* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.

***Selling Naked Calls***

If you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)

Notice ""To Break Even"" turns into ""Chance of Profit.""  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.

**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.

***Puts Explained***

Buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.

[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)

None of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.

* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised

***Buying Naked Puts***

The 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.
* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.
* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.

***Selling Naked Puts***

If you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.

**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS ""CAPPED"" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**

***Options Pricing***

The price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.

* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|
   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value
   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price. 
   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play
* Extrinsic Value
   * Effected by theta and implied volatility
   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
   * Theta
      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.
      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE

https://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d

* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV. 
   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.
   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.
   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.

***The Details***

Going back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774

This explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.

* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree
* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold
* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day
* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled

Bid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.

Open Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.

The lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.

***The Greeks***

You can see the Greeks listed above for this call.

* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.
* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.
* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.
* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.
* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.

Panda",Options Explained - A Quick Beginners Guide,44162.60278,t3_k2a2j8,"Options Explained - A Quick Beginners Guide Fellow Betters, if you understand options, move on.

First, proud of this community and all the giving it did yesterday.  Truly phenomenal.

I've noticed a lot of people on this sub legitimately don't know what options are or what they do.  This is incredibly concerning, how are we going to get to the moon if we don't know how to build a rocket.  As such, I've decided to write a quick reference options guide to help some of the newer, younger, or less experienced traders as a Christmas present to the sub. If you know what options are, move on.  I'm going to try and make this as short and sweet as possible.  A reference guide.

As much as we all like loss porn, I like seeing gain porn way more and hate the thought of people losing life savings/tuition money/inheritance because they come to the sub and don't know anything about options but see a ticker with rocket ships and buy a 0 DTE 30% out of the money call with everything they have.  Gotta know how to play blackjack to sit at the table.

Depending on feedback, I may write a few more.  If I get told to fuck off I completely understand, but if some people learn some stuff then I'll continue.  I will be using $MSFT as my example.

**Options Explained**

***The Basics***

Buying an option **gives you the right** to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a stock at a specific price (strike price) on or before the expiration date (European options are specifically on the expiration date).  Buying calls is bullish, buying puts is bearish.  To buy an option you are going to pay a premium as the other party will be accepting risk with the trade (premium explained more later).

* If you believe a stock is going to go up past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy calls.  
* If you believe a stock will go down past a certain price on or before a certain day, you buy puts.

Selling an option **obligates** you to buy (put) or sell (call) 100 shares of a stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date, really whenever the buyer wants to exercise the option.

* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.
* If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

***The Money***

For Calls:

* At the Money - A call with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A call with a strike price BELOW the current stock price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money - A call with a strike price ABOVE the current stock price.  The stock MUST rise to or above the strike price to be exercised.

For Puts:

* At the Money - A put with a strike price equal to the current stock price
* In the Money - A put with a strike price ABOVE the current strike price, can immediately be exercised
* Out of the Money -  A put with a strike price BELOW the current strike price, must fall to or below the strike price to be exercised

***Calls Explained***

Buying calls is a bullish strategy and the most popular on this sub, and thus will be covered first.  I will be using $MSFT as my example stock.  $MSFT is currently trading at $215.17 and I believe that the sale of the new XBox around Christmas time will increase the stock price to $230.0 by Christmas.  I would buy a call.  I decide to look at the Dec. 31 options which you can see below.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/v1li3ko65u161.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f4953ae3048e58bca84001d3caa2be444b0189)

This is Robinhood on a computer.  At the top you can see what each thing is which is explained below.

* Strike Price - The price the stock has to rise above to be exercised
* Break Even - The price the stock has to rise above to not lose money
* To Break Even - Percent change in the stock required to break even
* % Change - Daily change in option price in percent
* Change - Daily change in option price in dollars
* Price - Price of the option

In the above example:

* $215 Strike Price - In the Money, could be immediately exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $217.5 Strike Price - Out of the Money, could NOT be immediately exercised.

The Break Even point is always higher than the strike price for calls as you are paying someone to accept risk.  This can be calculated by taking the strike price and adding the premium paid for the option.  For the 12/31 $230, $230.0 + $1.67 = $231.67.  The option CAN BE EXERCISED BELOW THE BREAK EVEN FOR A LOSS.

***Buying Naked Calls***

Ok, so the 12/31 $230.0 strike is what we are going to buy, that is $1.67 dollars PER share, for 100 shares, so the buyer would pay a total of $167.00 for the trade (depending on the bid - ask, explained in ***The Details*** below.)  We go ahead an buy that option for a debit of $167.00.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing (explained in Greeks)

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.
* $MSFT is above the strike but below the breakeven, we'll say $231.00.  The contract will be very close to break even, and throughout the day will likely fluctuate to above and below.  If you are still bullish on $MSFT, this is the ONLY time I would recommend exercising the option to buy the share (AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO SO).  If you are bearish or do not have the capital, your best bet would be to sell the option for a slight loss.  In this case it would be around $100.  **NOTE: ROBINHOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SELL OPTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE CAPITAL TO EXERCISE THEM AND IT IS CLOSE TO THE STRIKE ON THE DAY OF EXPIRATION.**
* $MSFT is below the strike, hold or sell to avoid max loss.  Your max loss in the trade is $167 dollars, and the stock may run up towards the end of the day.  If $MSFT finishes the day below the strike, the option will expire worthless.

***Selling Naked Calls***

If you are neutral to bearish on $MSFT because you think the PS5 will outsell the XBox, you could sell the 12/31 $230.0C.  See below.

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/d8z02ztweu161.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38aef118e5984f02c90185de2e5cc9855c73a4e3)

Notice ""To Break Even"" turns into ""Chance of Profit.""  This is a calculation using the Greeks of your odds of coming out on top in this trade.  You sell this call.  This would mean you would be CREDITED with $167 dollars initially.  As the month goes on, if $MSFT goes up in value, you will begin to lose money on the trade, and if you desired to close the trade you would have to Buy to Close, meaning you payed more for the option then you sold it for.  If $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, the options contract will decrease and you can Buy to Close the call at a lower price than what you paid for it or just let it expire worthless on 12/31.

**SELLING NAKED CALLS CAN BE VERY RISKY.**  If you sell the call, and $MSFT shoots up the next day to $240.0, the buyer of your contract can immediately exercise the call.  This means that you as the seller are OBLIGATED to sell them 100 shares of $MSFT at $230.  What happens if you don't have them? You have to buy them at the current market price.  So $240.0 x 100 = $24,000.  You would then sell them for $230.0: $23,000. Your max loss on the trade will be $24,000 - $23,000 -$167.0 = $833.  And that is only if the price goes to $240.0.  If the price at expiration is $250, your max loss would be $1,833.  For every $10 increase in underlying, the max loss increases $1,000.  To avoid this and collect premium you can sell covered calls, to be discussed later.

***Puts Explained***

Buying puts is a bearish strategy and the second most popular on this sub.  $MSFT is still $215.17, and I believe the new XBox sucks.  I think the stock will fall to $205.0 on or before 12/31.  Below are 12/31 puts.

[Figure 3](https://preview.redd.it/svbfbulzcu161.png?width=1149&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e389a6b8a77e1b71c189615a6fb9acbee41553)

None of the metrics change, except for what is in and out of the money.

* $217.5 - In the Money, can immediately be exercised, but the buyer/exerciser would experience a loss
* $215 - Out of the Money, cannot immediately be exercised

***Buying Naked Puts***

The 12/31 $210.0 strike is what we are going to buy, so that is $3.58 for 100 shares, so if purchased and filled this would cost us $358.0 dollars.  Note this is much more expensive than the $230.0 call, this is a result of the strike price being much closer to the current stock price.

As the month goes on BEFORE 12/31, some things could happen:

* $MSFT goes down, the value of the option increases and can be sold for a profit at any time
* $MSFT goes up, the value of the option decreases and can be sold for a loss at any time
* $MSFT trades sideways, which will result in the value of the option decreasing

On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:

* $MSFT is below the breakeven, we'll say $200.0, you can sell the option for a profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, worth around ($10.00). ($210.0 - $200.0 = $10.00)  Again, per share, minus the debit, would again get us around $642.  Notice how this trades profit was lower with the same difference in strike price to underlying price on expiration. That is because the premium we paid for this trade was higher.
* $MSFT is below the strike price but above the breakeven, we'll say $207.0.  The contract will very throughout the day, and unless you have the capital to exercise Robinhood risk management will likely sell the thing whether you like it or not.
* $MSFT is above the strike price, you can sell to minimize profit OR hold until it expires worthless.

***Selling Naked Puts***

If you are neutral to bullish on $MSFT because you think the XBox will be meh, you could sell the 12/31 $210.0P.  This means you would be credited with $3.58.  If $MSFT decreases in value, the option price will increase in value, and you will lose money on the trade.  You can hold to expiration or Buy to Close at any time for a loss.  If $MSFT trades sideways or increases in value, the option will decrease in value, and you can Buy to Close for a profit at any time.

**THE SAME RISK APPLIES TO SELLING NAKED PUTS AS NAKED CALLS, BUT IS ""CAPPED"" AS A STOCK CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO.**

***Options Pricing***

The price of an option has two different parts, intrinsic and extrinsic value.

* Intrinsic Value = |Current Price - Strike Price|
   * An Out of the Money option has no Intrinsic Value
   * An In the Money Option has an Intrinsic Value equal to the difference in stock price and strike price. 
   * Example:  $MSFT price: $215.17.  For the 12/31 $212.5C, this option has an Intrinsic Value of $2.67 for each share, or $267.  BUT you can see in Figure 1 it is $7.30, or $730 dollars to buy.  That is where extrinsic value comes into play
* Extrinsic Value
   * Effected by theta and implied volatility
   * Can be calculated by Extrinsic Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value
   * Theta
      * The more time an option has to expiration, the higher it is priced.  This is because the underlying stock ($MSFT) has more time to move.
      * The theta curve accelerates around the 45 day mark, see the figure below.  You can see that as an option gets closer to its expiration it will lose value, regardless of if it is in or out of the money IT WILL DEPRECIATE

https://preview.redd.it/knprhfu1iu161.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a6189eafe6f7fb8662cf5cd467d2c9b588af9d

* Implied Volatility - a lot of math goes into this one, but its essentially how much a stock is likely to move during a give amount of time
   * Steady stocks, like $KO, tend to have lower IV. 
   * High growth stock or stocks that move a lot have higher IV.
   * The IV OF EACH OPTION will be different depending on expiration date, how far In or Out of the Money the stock is, and the movement of the underlying.
   * IV Crush - this occurs often after earnings and results from volatility decreasing.  Even with no movement in the price of the underlying an options price can be cut in half if the volatility drastically decreases, decreasing the extrinsic value.  BE CAREFUL IF YOU HOLD OPTIONS OVER A STOCKS EARNINGS.

***The Details***

Going back to our out of the money 12/31 $230.0C on $MSFT, if you select the option, you will open up the details surrounding that option.  This can be seen below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9jybsf99ju161.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28414c66b7307b4d47e6841693976f068c0af774

This explains more about the option and can explain why it is priced the way it is. From left to right.

* Bid - Highest price a person is willing to pay for the option and the amount of options asking to be bought at that price
* Ask - Lowest price a person is willing to sell the option and the amount of options offered to be sold at that price
* Mark - Often in between the Bid and Ask, what you see on the main options tree
* Previous Close - The price of the most recent option sold
* High - Highest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Low - Lowest price paid during the trading day for the option
* Volume - number of contracts traded during the trading day
* Open Interest - number of total contracts not settled

Bid-Ask Spread is the different between the Bid and Ask, in this case $.19.  The closer the bid ask spread, the more likely you are to get an order filled.  Slippage occurs as the spread moves up or down depending on if the movement of the stock.  If the stock is rising rapidly and you are trying to buy a call, by the time you enter the order the Bid-Ask Spread might have moved up dramatically, and your order might not get filled.

Open Interest is important as well.  If very low open interest, Selling or Buying to close may be very difficult depending on how popular the options contract is.

The lower the open interest and the wider the Bid-Ask Spread is, the more likely you are to get fucked by market makers.  They will not be willing to meet at the mark or change their bid/ask and will expect you to do it.  If they are moving millions of options a day, $.10 is a lot to them and they will profit off of it.

***The Greeks***

You can see the Greeks listed above for this call.

* Delta - how much an options price is expected to change for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Calls have positive delta, puts have negative delta.  If $MSFT goes from $215.0 to $216.0, the price of the option will increase $.1691.  Puts have negative delta because the options price will decrease as the stock price increases.  Delta will approach 1 as the stock underlying approaches the strike and moves through the strike, causing a natural increase in intrinsic value.
* Gamma - the change in Delta for every $1.00 change in the underlying.  Gamma increases as the stock approaches the strike price and can be very powerful if the underlying is near the strike.
* Theta - change in the option price for every 1 day closer to expiration.  Theta increases as the option approaches the expiration date.  If you hold onto the 12/31 $230C for a day it would decrease in value .06 per contract, so a total of $6.  You can see how this is an options buyers Enemy.
* Vega - How the implied volatility affects the price of the option.  A drop in vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.  Compare vega to normal levels by looking at other options of other similar underlying.  Again, BE CAUTIOUS OF IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS.
* Rho - sensitivity to interest rates, has to do with the U.S. treasury, you have the least control over this and this arguably effects options the least.

14079,,,,ceejwhich,p2d52w,117,692," Blackberry have just announced a new solution to deliver highly-secure vehicle-based payment capability to unlock a connected car payments market that is projected to reach over EUR530 billion by 2030. 

This vehicle-based payment solution will create new opportunities for automakers to offer a vast array of payment services and develop previously untapped revenue streams. The solution will create a ""digital fingerprint"" for the vehicle, allowing it to securely connect to a bank's payment network, validate, and autonomously pay for a wide range of frequently used services, including fuel, tolls, parking, insurance, maintenance, and other ""wallet"" capabilities. Historically, vehicle-based payment processes have been complex and leverage legacy banking primitives such as physical credit cards or multiple smartphone apps to communicate with each individual merchant and service provider.

This is a massive step and hopefully the first of a number of key pieces of news that could be used as potential catalysts for BB over the coming days. CEO John Chen is addressing investors as apart of JP Morgan Investor conference today. Typically Chen does not stand in for these meetings so the fact that hes coming out now to lead the show is a very bullish sign. There is still a long way to go, but this is the turning point now with another investor meeting with Cannacord tomorrow.

My sense is that GME was being massively shorted despite it being relatively healthy on the books because it's obviously doomed. They've had years to move into a new field and constantly failed. Look at Kongregate, they bought that and for years idled with it. Look at Miniclip vs Kongregate. 

And what I wanted to ask you clowns is what would actually fix GME? My thoughts:

My drug induced best guess is Gamestop will become Redbox. In dummy words: Gamestop will shut down physical large stores and sell games from vending machines due to increased digital sales. Gamestop used to be the place dad would go to have some smart nerd tell him which game to buy the kid so dad can see his mistress Yulia more often. Now it's literally just a smelly box with games.

So why don't they buy Redbox or another company that has logistics and tech to distribute games everywhere. There's only a handful of MUST HAVE games in any given quarter. This is a no brainer. Where is my mistake? Not enough coke?  


Other opportunities:

* something related with real money &amp; gambling
* become a nerd-community center (esports, more merch)

Here is a diagram of roles showing how money exchange hands. These are just roles, some companies act as multiple roles.

                        +-------&gt;    DTC     &lt;---------+                       |                              |                   buybroker -&gt; clearing company &lt;=[3 days]=&gt; clearing company -&gt; sellbroker  

When we buy or sell, money don't exchange hands immediately. They go via clearing process, where roughly speaking they just record all transactions, then settle the balance with each other **every 3 days** with a single balancing payment. It is important to understand, that balancing payment is much less than total volume of trade between clearing companies, because on average everyone trades with everyone. For this particular trade 3 day delay means, that sellers clearing company is on the hook: they already paid seller, but real money for this deal will come later.

What if buyers clearing company goes down? Nobody likes to be exposed, so the mechanism of collateral was invented. All clearing companies deposit cash in custodian (DTC) to guarantee that if counterparty goes bankrupt, they are not at loss or at least exposure is calculated upfront and accounted for. It's logical that collateral is calculated in proportion to the expected balancing payment.

When WSB started trading, all expectations were off, all risk models were out of the window. There was a risk that Melvin Capital wont be able to pay for the stocks they are buying or more precisely wont be able to clear 3 days down the line when settlement is due, this in turn would bankrupt other clearing companies on the market, causing cascading effect.

So custodian (DTC), being in a risk management business, decided that GME stocks causes to much risk and demanded 100% collateral . What does it mean in practice? Now suddenly clearing companies need to deposit 100% of **whole GME volume** they are trading, which is much more than what they could afford immediately. They had no option other than to refuse to clear GME trades, which in turned caused RH, WeBull &amp; others to shut buys.

Why European companies continue to trade? I don't know. Maybe their clearing process is much faster (minutes? hours?) and their exposure is much less as a result, so collateral requirements are significantly lower.

**Facebook Patent Settlement/Deal/Partnership Catalyst** 

Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement. Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more.

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram.

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares. 

**IVY Connected Car + Amazon Partnership**

As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY. *Following is a deep dive into that partnership* in anticipation of the AWS and IVY webinar on Feb 23rd 2PM EST.

Ivy benefits the whole value-chain

* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.
* The developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills.

Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.

* The consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data

Data is the new Gold/Oil

BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.

In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy “By the way this project, we’ve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years..we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..”.

He goes on to say that this creates a recuring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckensey&amp;Co report outlined (see my summary) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)
2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things",$BB BlackBerry the sleeping giant (Potential $2 Billion Facebook Settlement Coming + Amazon IVY connect car) 🍇,44432.75208,t3_pazmes,"$BB BlackBerry the sleeping giant (Potential $2 Billion Facebook Settlement Coming + Amazon IVY connect car) 🍇 &amp;#x200B;

As a Mckensey&amp;Co report outlined (see my summary) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.

Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:

1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)

Let's back out and think a little bit about why there is so much short interest on GME. Boomers like everyone else are trying to capitalize on patterns they see. What is the pattern they are seeing? JCPenny and ToyRUs.

I know autists and retards are 🦍s and blindly chasing 🥜s, but hear me out here. If we really want GME to moon, we need boomer money to be convinced that GameStop is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. How do we do that is by making the case to the institutional money that GameStop is legit. It's obvious to us because people our age actually enjoy spending time, money, and effort on video games. And guess what? For Gen Z people, video games are a lifestyle. As more young people matriculate into the workforce, the growth for the industry only looks bright.

Now I'll sneak in a 🌈🐻 argument here. We know that the future of video games is likely going to be Sass (think DLC, Skins, and Subscriptions) so there may not be much of a space for a middlemen like GME. But, from what I understand GameStop already has a somewhat sizable customer base. As all profitable e-commerce companies do, it is not about selling the product to the people, it is about selling the people to the product - we'll see how they do. Honestly, from what I can tell their in prime position to make this work.

&amp;#x200B;

But back to the point, if we really want to make a buck here, we have to convince boomer money that this is good idea. Let's be real here, only they have the capital to drive the price up significantly. If they do before the shorts are closed... well sorry Melvin, you made a bad trade. 🤑🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤑

So here's the real money making strategy - convince boomers that GME is not JCPenny/ToyRUs. Boomer money likely got screwed on those companies before so we need to make the case that GME isn't that and it's in fact a really good investment.
